To make up for reduced mobility the player can also block incoming attacks. Each stage culminates in a boss fight at the end, and between stages there are short dialogue scenes that drive the story, as well as an opportunity to buy and sell items.The team has three combat members: Amelia, Pink Dolphin team leader, cute redhead, and a crack shot; Drann, a large dragon-man who served under Amelia's grandfather during the wars, and who carries a large automatic rifle; and Liza, a girl from the Fox planet who wields a sword and talks like a samurai. Each has their own weapons and abilities, and the player can freely switch between them at any time. Each character also has their own life and weapon energy meter, so the player must take care to keep all three in good condition.

The game offers a two player VS mode allowing to select between nine fighters representing the main characters of the legend, along with a story mode where the player starts as the monkey king Sun Wuhong (better known as Son Goku) armed with his iconic extensible sfaff and gradually unlocks the other fighters as they are defeated in turn throughout a heavily stylized version of the traditional story. Once a battle is lost against the computer, the character the player was using becomes unavailable, and upon continuing he or she has to choose between one of those available up to that point.Gameplay features are reminiscent of Street Fighter, with similar movesets and impact feedback, while the presentation sees prerendered 3D sprites on static 2D backgrounds. The game includes about 30 minutes of full-motion video cutscenes featuring real actors in costumes varying from Chinese armor to rubber monster suits. These play in between battles as introduction for each new fighter. The whole production reminds of Japanese "sentai" TV serials, with exaggerated poses, extravagant martial arts flourishes and grotesque creature designs.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Falcata</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-06-01</td><td>Gust Co., Ltd.</td><td>Gust Co., Ltd.</td><td>Strategy</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>RPG elements</td><td>Fantasy, Middle East</td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">PlayStation Store Description (from Ad Blurbs)To download content to the Memory Stick PRO Duo™ of your PSP® (PlayStation®Portable) system, the free space required is twice the size of the content to be downloaded.This software is playable for PLAYSTATION®3 and PSP® (PlayStation®Portable).To download this software, you must also have at least 175MB of free space on your PLAYSTATION®3 system's hard disk.To play this software with your PSP®, the latest system software and a Memory Stick Duo™ with at least 175MB of free space are required.For more detail information about download to your PSP® system, please see below URL.http://asia.playstation.comWhen downloading using PC:When downloading contents to PSP®, you must install the PLAYSTATION®Network Downloader application first.

Kukuru must marry a man she doesn't love, and in order to avoid this marriage, she accepts the offer of the mayor: he asks her to extinguish the flame. As a result, the spirit awakes and threatens to destroy the world. A young adventurer named Arc arrives to the village at the same moment as Kukuru is standing frightened in front of the spirit. Arc immediately recognizes it - it was the murderer of his father! Before he realizes how that could be possible, the spirit disappears, and now Arc and Kukuru have to do everything in their powers to undo the error, to stop the spirit, and perhaps to avenge the death of Arc's father.Arc the Lad is a hybrid of traditional and strategy-based Japanese-style RPGs. The story unfolds as you are transported from location to location and enter battles - you don't walk around on the world map, choosing yourself which location to visit. The battles take place on a battle field, on which you can move and attack only when you approach the opponent.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Kururin Pa!</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-07-07</td><td>Sky Think Systems Co.

It tells the story of a simple Japanese teenager Yakumo, who lives in Tokyo and tries to study at his high school and to earn his living by working as a cross-dressing waiter at the same time. His father was a famous explorer and adventurer, but he died after a mysterious accident during one of his journeys to Tibet. One day, Yakumo meets a girl who calls herself Pai. She tells him that she belongs to an ancient powerful race of immortals, called the sanzhiyan, the three-eyed ones. It appears that Yakumo's father worked together with Pai, and that Pai's biggest wish is to become a normal human again. Since then, Yakumo and Pai work together, but they must be aware of other sanzhiyan - powerful demons with their own evil plans.The story of the game is based on the following episode: Yakumo receives a message from his friend, the Buddhist monk Naparvha, saying that a curse has fallen upon a village in China. A young girl was killed under mysterious circumstances, and two monks fell asleep and cannot wake up. Yakumo visits the village and begins the investigation, aided by Yue Hua, the sister of the dead girl. The game is a Japanese-style adventure. The game world is composed of still shots of locations and characters in anime style, and the player interacts with objects and characters by selecting choices from a menu (such as "Look", "Talk", etc.).

A boss appears at the end of each stage, and after this the player must choose what path to take in the next stage, as in Darius. Instead of lives, the player has a shield that takes damage from each hit, but is recharged at the end of each stage.The Sega CD version of the game features remixed CD-audio, and the Saturn version features a set of exclusive bonus levels.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Battle Arena Toshinden</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-08-01</td><td>Sony Computer Entertainment of America</td><td>Tamsoft Corporation</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td>Fighting</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In Battle Arena Toshinden eight world renown weapon fighters have been invited to a mysterious tournament. It is one of the first one-on-one beat-em-ups to feature the ability to sidestep a full 360 degrees around the opponent allowing one to strike from any angle. Aside from the 3D movement, Toshinden's game play can be considered similar to Street Fighter, but in 3d and with a little less depth to the moves.Two versions of Toshinden were released; for the Sony PlayStation and later a lesser known version for DOS PC's. However the PC version is not a straight port of the PlayStation version and plays and looks notably different despite sharing the same characters, attacks and controls.The U.S and E.U PlayStation versions of Toshinden feature redone voices in English and redone music using different instruments. The lyrics on Sofia's stage music in the Japanese version, which were actually in English, were removed in the process, likely due to their suggestive nature. Sofia's and Ellis' voices in the English translation are also notably adjusted, for presumably the same reason; while the other characters English voices generally match the tones of the original Japanese voice actors, Sofia is far less suggestive sounding, while Ellis sounds notably older.The later DOS version of Toshinden however, uses the same audio as the Japanese PlayStation version in all regions, albeit recorded at a considerably lower quality than they were on PlayStation.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Gakkō no Kowai Uwasa: Hanako-San ga Kita!!</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-08-11</td><td>Capcom Co., Ltd.</td><td>Amuse, Inc.</td><td>Adventure</td><td>1st-person</td><td>Licensed</td><td>Detective / mystery</td><td>Graphic adventure, Mini-games</td><td>Japan (Modern/Futuristic)</td><td></td><td>Point and select</td><td></td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Gakkō no Kowai Uwasa: Hanako-San ga Kita!! is based on the anime series of the same name.

Instead of offering  several generic courses, the three available (Spyglass Hill, Sawgrass and River Highlands) are in 3D, with height differences visible (as well as the limited 3D abilities of the console allow).The player can either chose to play as one of the 10 PGA Pros (whose swings were digitized), or go Pro - the game keeps track of statistics (longest drive, driving accuracy, best round, etc), a game (Tournament, Strokeplay, Skins, Match and Shootout), as well as a replay.Gameplaywise, PGA 96 uses the tried-and-proved triple click system - one to start the swing, other to set strength and a final one for accuracy. It's possible to fade or draw the ball (to bend the trajectory), add backspin and pitch or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts at the hole or go above a bush).The difficulty level affects mostly the leniency of the triple click hit areas - while at novice it is possible to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in pro levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no excuses taken. However, only in Pro it is possible to make the longest drives, as the amateur and novice levels take a few yards from the total capacity of the club.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Rayman</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-09-01</td><td>Ubi Soft Entertainment Software</td><td>Ubi Soft Paris Studios</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">When a villain known only as Mr. Dark appears, trouble brews in Rayman's world.

Players are rated on eight ability categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers.Up to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player for their team, and AI for missing players. This allows for four players to face each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third player with a CPU team-mate.The Tournament Edition ups each team's roster to three players, and allows for substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which lower a player's stats; encouraging you to sub them out and let them recover. Aside from the usual secret characters and cheat modes, the T.E. also includes four new additions you can individually enable from the special options menu:
"Hot Spots" are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points (up to a 9-point shot!) for making a basket while standing within them.Powerup icons appear randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when picked up. Some examples are instant "on-fire," enhanced 3-point accuracy, monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that knocks all other players to the ground."Juice Mode" increases the speed of the game up to 4x."Tournament Mode" disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and challenges you to defeat all the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also unlocks a higher CPU difficulty level.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Street Fighter: The Movie</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-09-05</td><td>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Capcom Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Arcade, Fighting</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Street Fighter: The Movie is a 2D versus fighting game based on the movie of the same name, which in turn is based on the well known Capcom series, Street Fighter.

Hermie Hopperhead is a young city kid with weird-looking red hair that sticks out in all directions.

The bipedal egg coaxes him to come with it, and Hermie is lead into another world called Egg World. The world's resident villain, Mad Migo, is trying to take over this world of innocent egg people. What's worse, the evil Migo has taken Hermie's girlfriend, Trish, hostage. It is now up to Hermie to put a stop to Mad Migo's plans and rescue his girlfriend. The gameplay is very similar to that of Mario games: enemies are usually defeated by jumping over them. A notable feature is the assistance of the inhabitants of the Egg world. Some of them follow the protagonist around and may turn into platforms and other things to help his progress.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Namco Soccer: Prime Goal</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-09-29</td><td>Namco Limited</td><td>Namco Limited</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Isometric</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">J-League Prime Goal EX is one of the first football games in Sony's console, following previous appearances in the SNES, Prime Goal is a straightforward action game with simple arcade controls. While the Japanese version features all 14 JLeague teams and fully licensed players, the European version features the same number of  national teams with fictional players, all from Europe. Game modes include friendly match, league and cup knockout modes, as well as an all-star game where the player chooses his stars from the best in the selected zone.Graphically, the game uses a polygonal playing field, while players are represented using sprites, and gameplay features a combination of the face buttons to perform actions (passing, lobbing, shooting, tackling and so on) with shoulder buttons to add swerve to the ball, change team tactics on the fly or pushing the camera backwards to find an open team mate.While gameplay is fast and simple, it has three quirks: first, unlike most modern offerings, the AI does not set up the target players for passes and crosses, making the player control the target player as soon as the ball is released in order to place them in the best position to complete the play, and also unlike most other games, the players are able to run freely off-bounds, allowing the player to capture a free ball close to the touchlines without risking touching it for a throw-in. The final main gameplay feature can be seen when the ball carrier faces a defender, as the camera quickly changes to behind the forward, as he tries to trick the defender into going the wrong way as the defender tries to steal the ball  by predicting where will the forward move, with the winner of the challenge being able to run a few meters unopposed. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Off-World Interceptor</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-09-29</td><td>Crystal Dynamics, Inc.</td><td>Crystal Dynamics, Inc.</td><td>Action, Racing / Driving</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td>Post-apocalyptic, Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">You play a Trashman, a bounty hunter paid to capture criminal scum hiding on harsh alien worlds.

Once enacted, the dimensional bridge between the two realms connects, allowing Kahn's extermination squads to invade and destroy Earth, and enslave the population's souls.A small team of Raiden's "Chosen Warriors" survives the attack: Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang and his ally Kung Lao, Special Forces agents Sonya Blade and Jax, the shaman Nightwolf, the riot cop Stryker, the nomadic Kabal, and former Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero, who has gone rogue from his clan. Facing the warriors are the mercenary Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, Sheeva, a female Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, and Queen Sindel herself.Mortal Kombat 3 brings new elements to the 2D fighting series: multi-level playfields, "Dial-A-Combo" attacks, a "Run" button to speed up the battles, and "Vs." codes, which unlock new powers and abilities once both players enter a code sequence in pre-match-up screens.

In the end of the previous game, the party of heroes finally acquired the Cosmic Forge. However, before they were able to decide what to do with it, it was taken away by a servant of the Cosmic Lords, the cyborg Aletheides. It appears that the Cosmic Forge was in fact a clue to the location of the Astral Dominae, the artifact of life, somewhere on the planet Guardia, which has now been revealed to the universe.The heroes then travel to Guardia, which is populated by many races and organizations with their own agendas, including the rhinoceros-like Imperial Umpani Federation and the spidery T'Rang affiliated with a malevolent being known as the Dark Savant, whose goal is to get rid of the Cosmic Lords. All these factions are looking for the Astral Dominae, finding which is the primary goal of the game. Depending on the decisions made by the player in the previous game (should he opt to import the party from there), the game will have different openings and begin in different locations. However, regardless of the initial premise, the player is free to follow or betray whatever faction he was supposed to be allied with. The gameplay system is very similar to that of its predecessor, retaining the races, the classes, the skills and the magic system it introduced to the series. The trademark first-person exploration and turn-based combat are present as well. Unlike the previous games, Crusaders of the Dark Savant allows the player to explore towns and vast forest areas between them, in addition to several large dungeons situated in different areas of the game world. Many NPCs have their own agendas and may move between locations as well, and even obtain crucial items themselves if the player-controlled party is not quick enough, forcing the player to change plans. The exotic setting contains elements of science fiction on top of the traditional fantasy background. Like in the previous game, encounters, events, as well as the heroes' reflections upon them are described through text messages.A few skills have been added, including swimming and climbing, as well as diplomacy. The latter reflects the more important role dialogues and interaction with NPCs play in the game compared to the previous installments of the series. A mapping skill has been added, which, if learned, displays - for the first time in the computer releases of Wizardry games - an automap on top of the exploration screen. Skills are increased with repeated usage and the characters now receive separate bonus points for each category (weapon, physical, and academia). Like before, magic is divided into four schools (Psionics, Alchemy, Theology, and Thaumaturgy) and six elemental categories.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Cyber Sled</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-10-18</td><td>Namco Hometek Inc.</td><td>Namco Limited</td><td>Action</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td>Mecha / giant robot</td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The year is 2067.

Stories about abductions and alien attacks became more and more widespread. Finally, after various nations of the world have failed to intercept the UFOs, their representatives met in a conference of global importance in Geneva, Switzerland. It was eventually decided to organize a secret paramilitary group, dubbed Extraterrestrial Combat Unit (X-COM). Starting with one base, two fighters, one transport, and a few soldiers, X-COM must locate the aliens, learn about their origins and technology, find out where their base is, and destroy it.X-COM: UFO Defense is a strategy game featuring separate but interlinked elements. On the strategic side, called GeoScape, you get a rotating view of the globe, where you see all visible UFOs (those that are within your detection range) as well as major cities and your base(s). You order movements from here, such as sending out fighters to intercept UFOs, transports with soldiers to assault/recover UFOs, and perhaps assaults on alien bases (if you find any). You also control your research, as you must invent better weapons (the Terran weapons are just no match against the alien weapons) quickly, not to mention all the other cool tech you can recover from the aliens. You also need to control your budget, as you can't afford to overextend your reach. Researchers need to be paid, engineers (who build the new toys) need to be paid, base(s) need to be be built/expanded, planes need to be bought/maintained, supplies need to be replenished, and so on.You can earn money by selling unneeded stuff, and you receive funding from the nations of the world; however, a nation can decrease its funding if it decides you aren't operating efficiently enough within its region. It's even possible that a nation gets so fed up with you that it signs a pact with the aliens and ceases funding altogether. Once you join a ground battle, the game switches to Battlescape, which is an isometric view of the battlefield with realistic line-of-sight calculations and turn-based combat. Your mission is usually extermination of all aliens on the battlefield, though if you can capture a few it would surely help your research efforts. If you win, you also recover any alien artifacts left on the field, which can then be researched.In combat, each of your soldiers has a specific number of Time Units. Doing anything (moving, shooting, turning around, rearranging objects in the inventory etc.) costs a number of TUs. Once a soldier is out of TUs, he cannot act any more this turn (he gets all his TUs back on the next turn, though).

Each of the girls has their own individual personality and problems, and the choices you make will determine whether they graduate from high school, what they do with their lives afterward, and whether or not they wind up hating your guts. Get them all into top colleges and your boss will praise your genius. If they all flunk or wind up wanting to marry you, you'll obviously be fired.Despite what common sense and knowledge of the Japanese psyche might lead you to believe, this is not an adult (or hentai) game and there's no nudity and only an average amount of anime sexploitation.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">FIFA Soccer 96</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-11-01</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Extended Play Productions</td><td>Simulation, Sports</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Managerial / business simulation</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control, Multiple units/characters control</td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td>2D scrolling, Isometric</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">FIFA Soccer 96 is a football (soccer) simulation.

Twenty-one years later Heihachi, now the head of a corrupt corporation, organizes a fighting championship his son is eager to join.Tekken is a versus fighting game similar in concept to Virtua Fighter. Besides Kazuya, other fighters of the tournament all have their own range of moves, something to prove, and a reason for any combat opponent to fear them. For example, Nina Williams is a trained assassin, Yoshimitsu is a robotic recreation of a ninja, and Marshall Law aims to set up a fighting school to pass on his knowledge. As one of these eight figures, the player must come through fights in a 360-degree 3D environments with texture mapped backdrops and polygon graphics. After beating the seven rivals there are two bosses to beat.

The conditions of the tournament are anything but ordinary: opponents fight each other in armored vehicles with mounted weapons. The winner receives an audience with Calypso, and is granted a single wish - a wish without limits, be it money, power, or even our reality itself. In 2005, the annual tournament is held again in Los Angeles, and twelve drivers, each with his own agenda, have come to compete to death.Twisted Metal is a vehicular combat game. The player selects one of the twelve available drivers and takes part in the competition. In the one-player story mode, the player must progress through six combat stages; all the opponents must be destroyed in order to win the race. In the two-player co-op mode, players choose a battlefield and control two cars in an attempt to get rid of the competition.All the vehicles are equipped with two mounted machine guns; though relatively weak, they have unlimited ammunition. Other weapons can be picked up by driving over them during the races. These include fire and homing missiles, land mines, tire spikes, and others. Each participant has a life bar, which can be replenished by entering a specific area on the stage.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Warhawk</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-11-10</td><td>Sony Computer Entertainment of America</td><td>SingleTrac Entertainment Technologies, Inc.</td><td>Action, Simulation</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td>Flight / aviation</td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Warhawk is an action/simulation game built around a futuristic VTOL craft.

He appears to be very good at it as well, because apparently the universe has decided to continuously challenge him. The game takes place in the humorous fantasy world created by Terry Pratchett. The world is called the Discworld, as it is actually a flat disc carried on the backs of four gigantic elephants, which themselves stand on the back of an even larger turtle.The story is loosely based on the novel "Guards! Guards!". Both in the book and the game, a dragon is summoned by a group of mysterious conspirators and now terrorizes the city state of Ankh-Morpork. Being the most expendable wizard of the Unseen University, Rincewind is given the task to get rid of the beast (only in the game though; in the book, the city's nightwatch has to deal with the problem).Discworld is a classical point-and-click adventure game with a few original features. For example, Rincewind's inventory is limited to two objects, and the majority of his belongings is stored in the Luggage, an intelligent chest with dozens of little feet. Furthermore, at a certain point in the game the player gains access to a time-traveling device and has to send Rincewind to the past and back in order to solve some of the puzzles.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Night Head: The Labyrinth</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-11-17</td><td>Fuji Television Network, Inc., Pony Canyon, Inc.</td><td>Scitron & Art Inc.</td><td>Adventure</td><td>1st-person</td><td>Licensed</td><td>Horror</td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Night Head: The Labyrinth is a mystery adventure game based on the Night Head TV show that tells the original story parallel to the TV series.

You must rely on your wits and the defence software to fend them off.The main game takes place in a first-person view inside the complex. Trams connect the maze-like living areas to a handful of manned turrets outside. You must shuttle between shooting down waves of fighters in the turrets, and scouring the base levels for card keys during the downtime.A third consideration is the "Virtual Operating System" controlling all major base functions. You use this interface to repair damage from attacks, monitor intruders, and place robot sentries to guard key passages. As you find more access keys, you can increase the software's efficiency to the point that you can command turrets remotely, or set them to auto-attack with a high degree of success. As defending the base becomes more automated and efficient, you have more time to search the levels for keys. Your ultimate goal is to find the clearance to self-destruct the base, defend your escape shuttle, and get out alive.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Criticom</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-11-29</td><td>Vic Tokai, Inc.</td><td>Kronos Digital Entertainment</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Fighting</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td>Farzad Varahramyan</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Criticom is a one-on-one fighting game where 8 diverse fighters from across the galaxy vie for a crystal artifact.

For those who've not played the original, you're competing against thirteen other "Road Rashers" who will stop at nothing to win. During the race, you have two options available: you can either do your best to cross the finish line or use your weapon to bring the Rashers to the ground if they give you trouble. Do the latter, and your opponents will do the same to you during the next race.There are five circuits to race: The City, The Peninsula, Pacific Highway, Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley. Some of these circuits are dangerous. In addition to the obstacles and traffic you encounter along the way, there are also police motorcycle units that will arrest you if you happen to crash or stop near them. Get caught, and you'll have to pay a fine to get in any more races. If you crash too often, your bike will be wrecked, forcing you to pay for damages. The amount you have to pay depends on the bike you are riding. Once you have completed the first five circuits, you have to race them again another four times - but at a much higher difficulty. Manage to win all five circuits on all levels, and you win the Road Rash cup!There are about five bikes to choose from, divided into three groups; Rat, Sport, and Super. You start the first level with a Rat bike. As you progress through the levels it will become increasingly important to pick bikes from different classes.If you have no plans to win the Road Rash cup, you can choose the game's Thrash mode. The difference between this and the other mode is that there is no money involved (i.e., you are not allowed to buy bikes), and you're competing against fourteen opponents. And if you wreck your bike or get busted, you have to start all over again. Regardless of the mode you pick, you will always start in the last place.The remake also contains FMV movies that usually depict the outcome of the races, as well as limited songs performed by various recording artists, including Soundgarden, Therapy?, Monster Magnet, and Swervedriver. These songs can be changed on-the-fly via the game's options menu.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Winning Post</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-12-29</td><td>KOEI Co., Ltd.</td><td>KOEI Co., Ltd.</td><td>Simulation, Sports</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Cinematic camera</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Winning Post lets the player take control of a stable of horses, breeding and training them for the ultimate goal, to win the French Grand Prix.The player can hire breeders, trainers, and jockeys and race in over 240 different races to earn more money.

This may be by design to represent the weight of the monsters; most of them are big and their fighting styles could be considered anything but skill based. For instance the Skeleton can jump on the opponent and stab them in the neck repeatedly with its sword while the Minotaur gores them with its horns. It must be said that the attacks in the game generally fit their respective monster.There are only two game modes available with the main one being the standard "Normal Mode" where one player goes up against the six other monsters and finally a mirror match.  A second player can join in at any point (in fact it's the only way a second player can play as there is no Vs mode). If one completes this mode they are presented with a breakdown of their performance in each fight, though no ending in the real sense, as the game has no story at tall to explain why these monsters are fighting each other.The second game mode is an innovative mode the game calls "Auto Mode" and devotes most of its manual to. In this mode the player functions as a side line trainer to train and guide an AI controlled monster (selectable from one of the same seven as the Normal Mode) through several tournaments. This is done by pressing various buttons on the controller to tell your monster to try to perform certain offensive or defensive plays.The monster you are training start's of with little more than the ability to throw a punch and is slow to respond to your prompts, but will gain additional attacks and respond quicker and more intelligently to your prompts the more it fights, until it ultimately gains the full range of attacks it would have in the Normal Mode.However the full potential of this mode is undermined by the games lack of any save feature.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Lone Soldier</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996</td><td>Telstar Electronic Studios Ltd.</td><td>Tempest Software Ltd</td><td>Action</td><td>Behind view</td><td>Regional differences</td><td>War</td><td>Shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">An alien force known as the Varinians have invaded Earth, and stolen an experimental "super-missile" in order to blackmail the world's governments into delivering further payloads of radioactive materials to them.

While the Arcade Race mode let's the player jump right into the fray after choosing their difficulty level (either rookie,veteran, or ace), the Simulation Race mode features a lot more customization options for the player to take into consideration.Simulation Race mode lets the player tweak their vehicles fuel usage, cross weights, tire pressure, the alignment of the camber and stagger of the wheels, the aerodynamics (air dam and spoiler), the shocks, and the gear ratios. The game also offers a Simulation Testing mode to let the player test these settings on the race track without the interference of other drivers.Both Arcade and Simulation Race modes let the player compete in a full 31-race championship season. After each race, players earn points depending on which position they placed in, which then affects their place in the season standings.The game features 16 licensed NASCAR tracks such as the Red Rock Raceway and the Bull Run Raceway. 3 of these tracks also have a nighttime version. There is also 2 fantasy tracks available to race on.

Panzer General was one of the first games (if not the first) that actually gave you the ability to play for the Nazis, and yet succeed where Hitler failed. Having total and complete control over land, sea, and air units, you must defeat the Allied dogs as fast as you can (to get a major victory), or slower than in history (to get a minor victory).The game's quality lies in the number of units. There are basically hundreds of Axis and Allied units from World War II, accompanied with "circled" animations and battle sounds, as well as marching or moving sounds. The Main menu is always located on the right side of the screen, with plenty of options and selections you can change to suit your preferences.A turn-based hexagon strategy game that will actually go faster if you have a faster computer, but will always be playable (speed doesn't go up to infinity). The first and original Panzer General, this installment would be followed by sequels and many other games in the series using the "General" name.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Pro Pinball: The Web</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996</td><td>Interplay Productions, Inc.</td><td>Cunning Developments</td><td>Action</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Pinball</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In this pinball simulation, you play on a table called "The Web". With the help of three flippers, you must send the ball into the various openings, trapdoors, and ramps. You can gain various bonuses (such as several balls to knock at the same time) if you play particularly well. Some of the targets activate special missions when you hit them with a ball. Those missions vary from aiming at specific targets to playing mini-games, such as shooting asteroids. After you have completed five missions, you'll be able to face the Dark Queen, the off-screen antagonist of the game.Unlike many other pinball games, "The Web" aims for realistic simulation of pinball. The game implements real table physics, and doesn't feature any unrealistic gadgets or living enemies.

Masamune Shirow, famous for the anime Ghost In The Shell, was involved with the character design.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Robotron X</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996</td><td>Midway Home Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Player 1</td><td>Action</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td>Isometric</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The arcade classic is taken to the next level, this time in 3D.

Gameplay is reminiscent of Spectre VR; the goal is to pilot a Slamjet (a hovercraft-like vehicle) around futuristic virtual landscapes and collect a series of glowing objects called "Orb-ids" while avoiding a series of enemies and bosses which require some puzzle-solving in order to defeat.Once you collect all the Orb-ids in a level you clean up the virtual zone, and move on to the next.Graphics are fully 3D with polygonal enemies and objects, and the game touts a dynamic soundtrack composed by alternative rock band God Lives Underwater.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Smash Court</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996</td><td>Namco Limited</td><td>Namco Limited</td><td>Sports</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Smash Court is an arcade-style tennis game that features quick play exhibition mode as well as fully fledged tennis club mode which lets you name and create your character and build it over time into a professional tennis player by playing in various leagues and participating in tournaments. The tennis club mode also lets you practice alone to learn how to hit the ball in different ways. You can start the tennis club mode alone on in two player mode. Unlike for exhibition mode, memory card is required to save your data when starting the tennis club mode.Exhibition mode quickly goes through basic selection such as playing as whether to play as singles (1-on-1) or doubles (2-on-2), choosing who controls which player (all combinations of Player and AI are included), select the tennis players for both sides (there are 24 playable characters, 12 male and 12 female ones), and deciding where you want to play (10 locations are available in total to choose from, each representing a specific country with the background setting, such as coastal town of Greece, temples in Thailand, sand beach in Tahiti, and other). The game is played in bird's eye perspective where hitting the ball requires precise timing and direction. The camera is always focused on and follows the ball since the field is larger than the visible area on the screen and supports scrolling in any direction.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Solar Eclipse</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996</td><td>Crystal Dynamics, Inc.</td><td>Crystal Dynamics, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td>Space flight</td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Solar Eclipse is a 3D space flight simulation shooter that takes place on and near the many moons of Saturn. You are a hot-shot pilot with a troubled past. You've been re-assigned to a new squadron aboard a Tomlinson-class carrier. There's trouble on a mining colony on the moon Janus. Your squadron is sent in to investigate, and uncover a lot more than they went looking for.Solar Eclipse plays kind of like a sequel to Total Eclipse for the 3DO, which gameplay is similar to Space Harrier. You can view the game from a behind-the-ship perspective, or an in-cockpit perspective, but the scrolling is on rails and the player can only travel in one direction. In each of the 9 missions you will find wave after wave of enemy ships, and a powerful boss ship at the end.The story in this game is told through a series of full-motion video clips. In addition to between-level scenes, FMV messages from your squad mates appear from time to time while you play the game.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Space Hulk: Vengeance of the Blood Angels</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Key Game</td><td>Action, Strategy</td><td>1st-person, Top-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Space Hulk: Vengeance of the Blood Angels is a mix of a First-Person-Shooter and a tactical fighting game. It is placed in the
Warhammer 40k background of the Games Workshop tabletop games. 
It is the successor of the PC game Space Hulk from 1993 and it tells of the fight between the Terminators of the Blood Angels Chapter of Space Marines and the Tyranid Genestealers.You control up to ten Terminators. You give them orders in a tactical screen and/or take over one of them and then move in a 3D environment and fight the Genestealers just as in a First-Person-Shooter. So the game includes tactical planning and fighting in a good balance.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Star Fighter</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996</td><td>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>The World Federation Entertainments Network</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td>Flight / aviation, Space flight</td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">3037. FedNet is now in control of the federation, and in an attempt to gain the trust of the population following decades of corruption and warfare, the FedNet Space Corps were sent to the outermost planets to crush the small-time warlords still running the show there. After being "convinced" to join them in a tour of duty, he is assigned to an elite flight group with the only purpose of testing the most cutting-edge technology.A remake of the original game of the same title released a few years before for the Acorn Archimedes platform, Starfighter 3000 features more detailed graphics (now all surfaces are texture-mapped and a fogging filter reduces clipping). Featuring 15 levels in 4 worlds, the player controls the Predator Mark-IV, a fighter ship capable of space and atmospheric flight. However, other than the handy boost button, the player has no control over the throttle, (unless he uses a flight stick with thrust controls such as 3DO's CH Pro stick) and must keep moving at all times. In post 3DO releases, only two points of view are available: behind (better for acrobatics and general flying) and cockpit (accurate aiming and NOE flight). The 3DO release contained several more, like a TV-style fly-by-cam, weapon cameras, and enemy cams that could show a nearby enemies' POV. By picking up crystals the player is able to upgrade his craft and obtain more ammo, and by combining colours, get more powerful weapons, some also obtainable from parachute drops sent by FedNet.One of the defining features of the game is using the laser (basic weapon) to terraform the map. As the game map is composed of tiles, some with higher or lower vertexes can be leveled by simply firing repeatedly at the same area. This allows players to strategically avoid heavy defense turrets by simply collapsing a hill, or destroy a heavier turret by simply burrowing the ground beneath it.The player starts the game with three lives and earns one every 250k points. Losing all lives means a game over, but as there isn't a profile for each pilot (like in Tie Fighter), the game can be resumed freely from the last savegame. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Steel Harbinger</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996</td><td>Mindscape, Inc.</td><td>Mindscape, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td>Post-apocalyptic, Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In the midst of a large-scale war, aliens invade. The attack begins with pods dropped on the Earth, designed to turn anyone foolish enough to come near into a bio-mechanical horror, determined to kill all humans, and very good at this task. Luckily, one of the pod's victims manages to escape halfway through the conversion process, retaining her mind. Now, the Steel Harbinger, backed up by a group of surviving  scientists, must travel the post-apocalyptic United States, destroying aliens, rescuing survivors, and searching for a way to stop the attack.Steel Harbinger is a 3d, top-down shooter, with the twist that you can eat the enemies you kill to regain health. Weapons, both human and alien, can be found around the large levels, as well as the standard keycards, consoles, and aliens. Between levels, full-motion videos explain the plot.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Super Football Champ</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996</td><td>Taito Corporation</td><td>Taito Corporation</td><td>Sports</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Back of Jewel Case - PlayStation (UK) (from Ad Blurbs)super football champ

When she leaves the office, her car explodes, and she dies. Determined to fulfill her final request, Jonathan prepares to re-visit Beyond Coast.Policenauts is a Japanese-style adventure with action elements, similar in many ways to Snatcher. The player interacts with the environment in a point-and-click fashion: positioning a cursor over an object allows the player character to examine it or perform other context-dependent actions. There are a few puzzles in the game, but most of the time the story is advanced by visiting various locations, examining objects, and talking to characters. Conversations usually include a selection of topics. Action sequences are similar to those of Snatcher, but are more numerous and varied. The player must rapidly shoot enemies moving within a one-screen area viewed from a first-person perspective, reloading the gun manually and trying to eliminate the enemy before Jonathan's health bar is depleted. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Dai-4-ji Super Robot Taisen</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-01-26</td><td>Banpresto Co., Ltd.</td><td>Winky Soft Co., Ltd.</td><td>Strategy</td><td>Top-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td>War</td><td>Tactical RPG, Turn-based strategy</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td>Mecha / giant robot</td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The proper sequel to the  third game and EX.Three months have passed since the third game, where a race of extraterrestrials, known as the "Inspectors", attacked Earth Federation forces (Mobile Suit Gundam).

After an accident during a car chase he awakens in an hospital - only to find out that his face was operated to look like his eternal enemy. Now he is a wanted man...The controls of the game are similar to The 7th Guest: in a first-perspective view the player clicks on interactive items and a video clip shows the result. The game is designed to give an expression of the time pressure the protagonist is under - he has to react fast or he dies. This is also true when meeting other characters; in many situations Jack needs to use his gun to avoid being killed. Often he runs into conversations with people and robots instead of shooting them directly; then the player doesn't choose the exact answer but only the mood (aggressive, passive or normal) Jack answers in. The wrong approach may result in death. The protagonist can't walk freely through the city; the game consists of several single screens which have to be left by clicking on an exit, followed by a walking animation. There are quite a few places to visit, e.g. bars or a museum, but choosing the wrong path or hot spot generally leads to an instant death. There are also a few basic inventory-based puzzles to solve. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">King's Field</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-02-15</td><td>ASCII Entertainment Software, Inc.</td><td>FromSoftware, Inc.</td><td>Action, Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The powerful and holy Moonlight Sword was stolen from King Alfred of Verdite.

Alexander miraculously survives and is washed ashore on the mysterious island of Melanat. He has to explore the island, aware of the monsters roaming it, and find the sword.King's Field (originally dubbed King's Field II) is the second game in the series, and the first one to become localized in Western countries. Like its predecessor, it is a first-person 3D action role-playing game with a heavy emphasis on dungeon crawling. The game takes place in world consisting of interconnected areas, which gradually open up as the player acquires keys and other means to enter them. Most of the time the player is free to explore large areas, though he may encounter powerful enemies he is yet unable to defeat.The player character can attack physically with melee or ranged weapons (bows), as well as cast magic. Physical attacks and spells are each assigned to a different button. Character growth is handled by repeatedly executing the same types of attacks and applying certain items to raise attributes. New in this installment is the learning of magic from special crystals. Most of the creatures encountered in the game are hostile, with only a few offering help such as procuring different types of crystals needed to make healing potions. Every NPC in the game, whether hostile or friendly, can be killed by the player. Alexander can sprint now, though doing this depletes his hit and magic points and he must rest for a while to recover them. It is also possible to teleport between areas.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Krazy Ivan</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-02-15</td><td>Psygnosis Limited</td><td>Psygnosis Limited</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Shooter</td><td>Europe, Middle East, Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td>Mecha / giant robot</td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In the early 21st century, the Earth is under attack by aliens. In five areas of the planet, they have erected energy generators, creating a field that slowly encompasses the entire planet surface. They have also taken hundreds of humans prisoner. Someone has to stop them. Enter Russian Commander Ivan Popovich, nicknamed "Krazy Ivan". He is a paranoid schizophrenic, prone to burst out into violence at any time. In other words, he's perfect for the job.The player controls Ivan's "Steel Cossack" power suit on the three-dimensional battlefields. In each of the five areas in the game, two kinds of enemies can be found: Drones and Sentients. Drones are smaller air and ground vehicles that often respawn. Sentients are mechs similar in size and capability to the Steel Cossack. Each of the Sentients must be eliminated before the energy field generator can be destroyed to complete the mission.The Cossack is capable of carrying lots of weapons: projectile and energy guns, unguided and guided missiles, and other special weapons. Destroyed enemies reveal captured humans, to be rescued by Ivan, and power-ups, which recharge shields or rearm weapons.After a successful mission, Ivan can upgrade the Cossack with more powerful weapons and replace the mech's armor.Between the missions, rather humorous live-action cutscenes (starring English actors sporting thick Russian accents) continue the story.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Doraemon: Nobita to Fukkatsu no Hoshi</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-02-16</td><td>Epoch Co., Ltd.</td><td>Epoch Co., Ltd., Sakata SAS Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">One winter, the robotic blue cat from the future, Doraemon, takes Nobita and his friends on a trip into outer space.

The year is 2047 (or 2042, according to the original Japanese version). Mankind is facing its gravest crisis. A mysterious bio-roid life form has appeared. Its true nature and purpose are unknown. Is it some country's secret weapon, or an alien from another world? They appear in the winter, killing people and taking their place in society. They wear artificial skin and can sweat and even bleed. They are called "Snatchers" because they "snatch" their victims before they take their place.A new police force, specifically trained to fight the Snatchers, has been formed. They are JUNKERs (which is deciphered as "Japanese Undercover Neuro-Kinetic Elimination Rangers" in the English version). Every time you encounter someone, a difficult question must be asked — is it a person or a snatcher? The player takes control of Gillian Seed, one of the JUNKERs. The gameplay largely follows the structure of a Japanese-style adventure. The player uses a menu-driven interface to execute commands, which include moving between locations and interacting with the environment. Typically, every room contains objects that can be examined, leading to text descriptions and comments. Conversations occupy a large portion of the gameplay, with various topics available and a wealth of information about the game's world and characters. A few parts contain light puzzle-solving elements, though as a rule the game is almost completely devoid of puzzles.During key moments of the narrative, the player will be prompted to participate in intense shooting sequences. The goal is usually to kill all the enemies that pop out on the screen before they are able to kill Gillian. Some of such sequences are timed, i.e. the player is required to quickly shoot before another events is triggered, leading to the protagonist's death.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Vehicle Cavalier</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-02-16</td><td>Vanguard Works</td><td>Vanguard Works</td><td>Action</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td>Mecha / giant robot</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">PlayStation Store Description (from Ad Blurbs)Fast-paced gun-blazing action awaits in this classic mecha deathmatch.

Johnny's guitar Anita has been taken from him and he sets out to escape and vanquish foes on his way to be reunited with Anita. He can perform moves such as 360-degree spin jumps and hover jumps, among others, while using his bazooka guitar as a weapon.  When powered up, it can emit a special sonic blast that fries anything within hearing range.

You then select several buildings from a Bomberman-style map screen, and these spires include an underwater building, a medieval clock tower in which its hands are a hazard, a haunted skyscraper, and a beanstalk.The object of the game is, as always, to reach the top of the building using the blueprints as a guide. While working your way to the top, you must dodge various obstacles that get in your way. More often than not, you do not fall off the building if one of the objects hits you, unless you try to dodge when you come in contact with them. Falling off a building will result in a loss of life. When you reach the top of a building, you have to hop onto some sort of vehicle that will take you to the next building. Coins are awarded at the completion of each standard level.To increase your chances of reaching the top, power-ups can be obtained, and include a time-stopping clock and window-shattering sticks of dynamite. When you complete the second stage, the game unlocks the building at the center of the map.

The game never takes itself seriously, featuring a lot of slapstick humor and a laugh track when Keaton uses an item in the wrong place or gets into a trap. There are no enemies, Keaton can't die in the game and the traps that are scattered across the mansion are mainly for comic relief making it kid friendly.

Each section consists of about 10 missions. In every mission, certain goals must be accomplished to continue. These include killing a certain number of enemies, finding items or activating switches.Enemies include everything the alien life cycle provides: facehuggers, chestbursters, warrior aliens, dog aliens (from Alien³) and alien queens, one of which waits in the final mission of every section. In addition to the Aliens, you also have to fight employees of the Company, who have either been infected by the aliens and are beyond saving or who actively want to obstruct your mission.Weapons to be used include pistol, shotgun, pulse rifle, flame thrower and smart gun. Ammunition, health upgrades and other useful items are scattered throughout the levels. Hidden areas may be uncovered by using explosives like grenades and seismic charges. An auto mapping system helps in not getting lost, night goggles and shoulder lamps (running on battery power) allow you to see in the dark and the motion tracker tells you where your enemies are - but only if they are moving.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Brain Dead 13</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-03-01</td><td>ReadySoft Incorporated</td><td>ReadySoft Incorporated</td><td>Action</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Quick Time Events (QTEs)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In Brain Dead 13, the player takes on the role of a young computer expert who one day is called to fix a computer at some scary castle and in no time flat, finds himself in trouble.It is up to the player to use the complex moves of an interactive movie to escape from the castle.

Well, maybe not every; but in Japan, this seems to be a rather popular theme. Mysterious disappearances, ghostly photographs, untimely deaths, eerie sounds coming out of the music room - all these things attract the curiosity of three high-school girls: Yukari, Mika, and Chisato. At night, armed with nothing but a flashlight, the trio of heroines enters the dark school building, prepared to explore every corner, and investigate every urban legend they have heard of...Tansaku-hen opens the  Twilight Syndrome horror adventure series, defining its stylistic traits and gameplay. The game is divided into chapters, each dedicated to a particular "ghostly" story. Unlike most Japanese-style adventures, there is physical character navigation in the game; the player moves digitized images of the three girls on 2D backgrounds, in a manner somewhat similar to side-scrolling games - though many areas feature a third dimension, like in Western third-person perspective adventures.The gameplay consists of two activities only: walking and occasionally choosing a dialogue option and/or action, as prompted by the game's narrative. There is no other kind of interaction, no inventory, and no combat. Different choices may lead to different endings; the next chapter can be accessed only if the player has not attained the "bad" ending.Twilight Syndrome: Tansaku-hen abandons the nearly omnipresent anime/manga graphical style of Japanese games in favor of digitized images and photos of real people.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Williams Arcade Classics</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-03-01</td><td>Williams Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Digital Eclipse Software, Inc.</td><td>Action, Compilation</td><td>Side view, Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Shooter</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Williams Arcade Classics is a compilation that includes the following games:

Nevertheless, she must press forward to save her father and herself.D is a puzzle game requiring Laura to solve esoteric inventory puzzles on a very strict time limit.

Instead of anime-style portraits of school girls, there are pictures (and a few full motion videos) of real Japanese young women. Gameplay follows the same formula as the other graduation games: as a high school teacher, the player's task is to successfully lead five high school girls to their graduation. Most of the activities consist of making schedules, organizing classes, and giving assignments to the girls. It is necessary to know the strength and the weaknesses of each girl, in order to choose correct activities. The teacher supervises not only everything the girls do in the school, but also some of their activities during leisure time, including making plans for the holidays.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Descent</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-03-12</td><td>Interplay Productions, Inc.</td><td>Parallax Software Corp.</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td>Space flight</td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The Post-Terran Minerals Corporation (PTMC) digs up minerals on all nine planets of the solar system, employing humans and robots to do its job. Unfortunately, the mining robots are now being controlled by a hacker, and have taken the human workers hostage. The PTMC has tried to get the robots back under their control, but communication with the mining stations has been lost. In desperation, the PTMC modifies a Pyro-GX ship for combat and hires a mercenary, codenamed "Material Defender", to fly it. The mission is to destroy the infected mines and rescue human hostages, destroying any hostile robot that gets in the way.Descent is a 3D first-person game that puts the player at the controls of the Pyro-GX spaceship. Descent is notable in that the player travels through various interior locations (mines) but can do so in 720 degrees of movement. The ship however only moves forward and backward in any of the directions it is facing. The ship is able to use a variety of weapons scattered as power-ups throughout each level. They include: standard lasers, the Vulcan Cannon (a chaingun-like weapon), the Spreadfire Cannon (a rapidly firing, shotgun-like energy weapon), the Plasma Cannon (a rapidly firing energy weapon more suited for medium-range combat), and the Fusion Cannon (fires a ball of energy that's more powerful the longer it is charged it up, but could destroy the ship). All of these weapons, except for the Vulcan Cannon, use the ship's energy supply. The Pyro-PX is also capable of firing regular concussion missiles, homing missiles, proximity bombs (sits in the sky, then explodes when something gets close to it), smart missiles (more powerful homing missiles that fire out homing energy balls upon impact with their target), and Mega Missiles (the ultimate weapons of mass destruction).The goal of each level is to locate and destroy the mine's reactor. Once completed, there are only 45 seconds to find the escape hatch to get out of the mine before it explodes. As progress is made through the game, the AI will adapt to player's strategies and attempt to prevent the player from reaching the goals.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Zork I: The Great Underground Empire</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-03-15</td><td>Shoeisha Co., Ltd.</td><td>Arc System Works Co., Ltd.</td><td>Adventure</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td>Interactive fiction / text adventure, Puzzle elements</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td>Koji Saito</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">A radical graphical remake of Zork: The Great Underground Empire made some 19 years after the series debut on a PDP-10 mainframe at MIT, this version boasts the incorporation of modern gameplay amenities undreamed of the first time around, such as automapping and, er, graphics.Given ample time to drift wildly, the story and premise appear to have remained remarkably close to the source material -- the locations, layout and denizens of this fantastical subterranean treasure-hunt familiar to anyone with even a passing acquaintance with the original game.  Where the biggest change lies, of course, is in the transition from the text parser to an interface controllable by a console's joystick.  Adapting some sentence-construction conventions from the graphical adventure game genre (and the interfaces of Lucasfilm's and Legend's early entries in particular), menus selectable with a joystick pointer fill in for common "action" verbs while icons represent the inventory items the verbs influence; an expanded compass rose permits precise navigation of the Flatheadian ruins.

Like previous titles, the game is an airline management simulation however graphics and interface have been updated to 3D. Players take control of an airline as it's CEO, and must first select the name, tail logo and home airport of their airline. The game is turn-based between each airline. Each airline has four "board members" who can be assigned to perform various tasks, which take varying length to accomplish. These tasks include buying aircraft, bidding for slots at an airport, buying facilities at an airport and marketing a PR campaign in a region. Once the player has purchased aircraft, they must further make planning of the route between two airports with available slots. Once a route is setup, the player is able to manage how many planes fly the route daily and the number of passengers they carry, as well as ticket price.The game is played over one of two scenarios, each representing a different era. The game is over when any airline reaches the target money amount.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Ganbare Goemon: Uchū Kaizoku Akogingu</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-03-22</td><td>Konami Co., Ltd.</td><td>Konami Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view, Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Visual Design Room , Muneharu Samejima (さめじまむねはる)</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">First 32-bit title in the Ganbare Goemon series of platform/adventure games in which you take control of the heroic Goemon and his gang of buddies as he attempts to save feudal Japan and the world from evil.

The girls of the Jahana group who starred in the previous games return, with the new main protagonist being the young martial artist Yuka Takeuchi, who has been training in a secluded forest area before joining the competition. Like its predecessors, Advanced V.G. is a fighting game, with the basic "kick" and "punch" moves, while the various special attacks are executed by pressing combinations of buttons. There are three modes in the game, "Normal", "Vs.", and "Story". The normal mode is basically training matches between the player character and an AI-controlled girl. Vs. mode allows two-player mode, as well as demo "computer vs. computer" gameplay, with the possibility to choose any of the stages.

You are a leader of a nation. You begin in the Stone Age, and complete the game in the XXIth century (unless your civilization gets destroyed earlier). Your eventual goal is to become the dominant civilization in the world, either by wiping out everybody else, or being the first to get a space ship to Alpha Centauri.As the nation's leader, you have many responsibilities. You have to build cities, and then micromanage them, constructing various buildings. Most of people in your cities will be working on the neighbouring lands to get food (without it, your city won't survive or grow), production (used to build military units and buildings) and trade (which can be exchanged for money, science (see below) or luxuries that make people happy. You decide how much trade you want to invest into each of these areas.) You have to make sure that your people are in a good mood; if they get too unhappy, the city will collapse into disorder, and won't produce anything until you fix the situation. If you're ambitious, you can build Wonders of the World - epic constructions, such as the Pyramids or the Hoover Dam. Each Wonder is an unique thing, and only one of each can exist in the world. They give you a lot of benefits if you complete them, but they take a long time to build, and many of them will eventually stop working. There are other nations in the world, and there are also barbarians, so you'll have to invest into the military to protect yourself and to attack. Sure, you can sign peace treaties with other nations, and even exchange scientific knowledge with them (although sometimes they'll demand tribute from you), but eventually you'll probably have to fight. You control each of your military units on the world map, attacking your opponents' units and cities (possibly taking over them). Not all units are for combat though. Settlers are used to build cities, create roads (for easier travel of your units) and improve the land around cities, increasing production. Diplomats can be sent to foreign cities to negotiate with the other nations or create embassies, but they can also bribe enemy units to join you and conduct espionage and sabotage in the enemies' cities. Caravans can be sent to faraway cities to increase trade in their home city, and they can also help in building Wonders of the World. Scientific progress is an important part of the game. The more science your cities produce, the faster you research new technologies. Initially, you'll be finding out about the wonders of Alphabet or Bronze Working, but late in the game you'll be researching Computers and Robotics. Most technologies give you some new units, buildings and other things, although some have more interesting effects - for example, after inventing the Automobile, you'll find out that your citizens started producing pollution. Pollution is a bad thing; if there's too much of it, global warming may occur. How your cities prosper depends partially on the type of government that your nation has. Initially you're living in Despotism, but this can stunt growth of your civilization, so it's a good idea to switch to something else - Monarchy, Republic, Democracy or Communism. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Slam 'N Jam '96 featuring Magic &amp; Kareem</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-05-01</td><td>Crystal Dynamics, Inc.</td><td>Left Field Productions, Inc.</td><td>Sports</td><td>Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">A fast paced 5-on-5 basketball game very similar to the Run and Gun series from Konami.

There are also three new bosses and hidden characters raising the total number of fighters to 15 (up from 10).Toshinden 2, on top of additional special attacks for every character, adds several running attacks to each character: the ability to strike a grounded opponent with new ground attacks and the powerful Overdrive attacks that one must fill up a bar by using other attacks to be able to use.Toshinden 2 also does away with the free-form combo system of the original Toshinden replacing it with a simple combo system (i.e. light attack, hard attack, special or light attack, light attack, hard attack, special). The 3D movement in Toshinden 2 has also been made notably slower to prevent the heavy abuse it could be used for in the original.As a result, while the core game play is similar, this sequel is more tactical than the original game. Where as in the original Toshinden, one could throw normal attacks (i.e. light slashes) around with fairly reckless abandon and sidestep repeatedly without fear of their opponent being able to counter them easily, opponents in Toshinden 2 are able to capitalize on individual missed attacks.As a result, Toshinden 2 is more balanced than its predecessor. This balance was further tweaked with a re-release called "Toshinden 2 plus" in Japan.Unlike the Playstation release of the original Toshinden, Toshinden 2 was not re-dubbed for releases outside of Japan.Also unlike the original Toshinden, the PC release of Toshinden 2 for Windows computers, is a straight port of the Playstation version and supports Direct3D rather than specific 3D cards.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Dezaemon Plus</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-05-24</td><td>Athena Co., Ltd.</td><td>Athena Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Shooter</td><td></td><td>Flight / aviation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Dezaemon Plus is an updated PlayStation release of Dezaemon on the Super Famicom.

Players can control enemy placement, behavior, weapons, powerups, boss firing points, and so on.  A graphics editor allows players to draw backgrounds, along with sprites for players, enemies, and even explosions.  A music editor, very similar to the one in Mario Paint allows players to construct background themes for each level.  Players are limited to a maximum of five levels, and a limited amount of shared memory for all graphics.Dezaemon Plus's changes primarily include parallax scrolling for enemy sprites and backgrounds, and a selection of new or altered instruments in the music editor.  Players can save their creations to a memory card and share them with friends.  The game also supports the PlayStation mouse, making graphics editing a little easier.Dezaemon Plus also contains an updated version of the Super Famicom's demo game Daioh Gale (which players can use as a template for editing), as well as submissions from two editing contests held by Athena.  13 winners and runner-ups are included, 9 of which are fully playable.  The remaining submissions are included as gameplay videos.  All submissions were created using the Dezaemon tools, giving players some ideas of what they can create with them.The game was released on the PlayStation Network in Japan, and as a "PSOne Classics Japanese import" (so menus are untranslated) in the U.S. and Europe.  The game does not feature USB mouse support or analogue controls, making image editing somewhat difficult.  However, created games can be copied to PlayStation Memory Sticks and shared. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Dragon Ball Z: Idainaru Dragon Ball Densetsu</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-05-31</td><td>Bandai Co., Ltd.</td><td>BEC Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Fighting</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Idainaru Dragon Ball Densetsu is a game that adds another Dragon Ball to the franchise of the same name and starts with the events of the Saiyan Saga and the fight with Vegeta and Nappa.In Idainaru Dragon Ball Densetsu you don’t have your natural one on one fights. At the beginning of each fight you are given a total of 4 fighters (up to 6 later) from which you have to choose the 3 that you would like to participate in the battle that follows. Each fighter has 2 bars – a green and a yellow one. The green represents the life force and the yellow the power force which is depleted with every attack you do. At the bottom of the screen there is a blue bar and a red one that form a gauge called Power Balance. The reason for this gauge to be there is because your attacks don’t affect the enemies’ life bar directly. By continuously attacking the enemy the bar that represents your power (blue bar) increases while that of the enemy (red bar) decreases. When the blue bar covers all the gauge a random attack sequence, from the current character you’re controlling, is initiated and that’s how you can actually injure your opponents. The same can happen to you though if the enemy’s red bar covers all the gauge.

Once activated this special power sends back all enemies that have been sucked in into a beam of energy and it grants a short period of invincibility. There is also a backfire cannon helpful against enemies attacking from the left side of the screen. If the boy is hit once he loses all his weapon upgrades, and a second hit destroys the boy.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Olympic Games: Atlanta 1996</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-06-01</td><td>U.S. Gold Ltd.</td><td>Silicon Dreams Studio Ltd.</td><td>Simulation, Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">An officially licensed product of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, Inc.This was the first true 3D multi-event sports game with 15 sporting events (100 meters, 400 meters, 100M crawl, Javelin, Hammer, Discus, Long Jump, Triple Jump, High Jump, Pole Vault, Fencing, Rapid Fire Pistol, Weight Lifting, Archery, Skeet Shooting) that mirrored those in the actual Atlanta '96 games.The game supported up to 8 players, competing in arcade-style games and Olympic-style tournaments.The in-game commentary was by BBC Radio 5's Alan Green.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Silverload</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-06-01</td><td>Vic Tokai, Inc.</td><td>Millennium Interactive Ltd.</td><td>Adventure</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td>Horror</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Somewhere in the Old West lies Silverload, an old mining time.

Ten camera styles are available, encompassing both fixed and moving camera work.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Neo Planet</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-07-05</td><td>Map Japan Co., Ltd.</td><td>Map Japan Co., Ltd.</td><td>Simulation</td><td>Text-based / Spreadsheet</td><td></td><td></td><td>City building / construction simulation, Managerial / business simulation</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">PlayStation Store Description (from Ad Blurbs)Purchase this PS one® Classic and play it on both your PS3™ and PSP® (PlayStation®Portable) systems!

In this version the player wakes up in a hospital, and after jumping from the building's roof, is guided to the same tent and labyrinth as in the PC-98 version.

It is populated by four different races, which have been living in peace and prosperity, until a mad scientist Dr. Funfrock of the Quetch (human-like) race used his newly invented cloning and teleporting techniques to create an army of fearsome soldiers and become the planet's dictator. Twinsun's inhabitants have not lost hope, placing their faith in the old legend about the benevolent goddess Sendell who would save the world. However, Dr. Funfrock totalitarian regime forbade displaying any images of the goddess and her worship. A young Quetch named Twinsen was just a regular fellow until he had a dream, which surprisingly involved the outlawed goddess. It seems that Dr. Funfrock was no stranger to mind control; in his opinion, even dreaming of the goddess was illegal, and he promptly ordered to put the perpetrator in prison. Now the unlikely hero must find a way to escape and eventually save his planet from the clutches of its insane ruler.Little Big Adventure (Relentless: Twinsen's Adventure in the US) is primarily an adventure game with strong action elements. As usually in adventure games, the hero must talk to other characters, and collect and use objects. However, not all the problems have to be solved with dialogue and item manipulation. The player can activate four different behavior modes for Twinsen: Normal, Aggressive, Athletic, and Discreet. The first is used for peaceful exploration and conversations; Aggressive mode allows Twinsen to punch and kick other characters; Athletic mode must be applied when it becomes necessary to run quickly and jump; Discreet effectively puts Twinsen in a stealth mode, making it possible to sneak by hostile character unnoticed. While activation of a particular mode is often required to solve a problem, many situations can be dealt with in different ways.The game universe is rendered with characters in full 3D, while the environment uses isometric graphic tiles. The CD version (which was released earlier than the floppy one) features pre-rendered animated cutscenes, audio music and speech; all these features are absent from the floppy disk version.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Strikers 1945</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-07-19</td><td>Atlus Co., Ltd.</td><td>Psikyo</td><td>Action</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Shooter</td><td>World War II</td><td>Flight / aviation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Strikers 1945, not to be confused with the US PSX game Strikers 1945, which is actually the sequel Strikers 1945 II, is a port of the top-down vertically-scrolling arcade shooter. Set during World War II, the player can choose from different ships and pilots to engage the enemy. At the end of the war, all sides are left powerless and defeated. A secret organization known as CANY manages to initiate a coup among each country's military forces. The last resort is a team assembled with the best fighters from the US, Japan, Germany and England, with the goal to push back CANY.The list of planes and pilots includes:
P-38 (Lockheed P-38 Lightning) - Cindy Volton
P-51 (North American P-51 Mustang) - Tina Prize
Spitfire (Supermarine Spitfire) - Alice Herring
Bf-109 (Messerschmitt Bf-109/Me-109) - Lean Beirer

Destroyed enemies and buildings leave behind gold bars for bonus points. This adaptation includes two original modes, an arcade mode and an index of the different fighters.

The first mystery involves a girl named Sakura Himegami, who was killed in an accident many years ago; apparently, her ghost is still around somewhere. The trail leads to an abandoned path in the mountains; Mika decides to venture there, while the other two are going back to school at night, hoping to find more clues.The gameplay is identical to that of the previous entry: the player navigates the digitized images of the girls over 2D backgrounds in a side-scrolling/third-person perspective manner, searching for clues, triggering scenes, and choosing responses and/or actions when prompted by the narrative. As in the first game, these choices may influence the course of the story, and lead to various endings of the chapters; reaching a "bad" ending prevents the player from continuing to the next chapter.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Angel Graffiti: Anata e no Profile</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-07-26</td><td>Coconuts Japan Entertainment Co., Ltd.</td><td>Astrovision</td><td>Adventure, Simulation</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td>Visual novel</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Buy at Buy at </td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Angel Graffiti is a visual novel romance simulation game for PlayStation, ported a year later to Sega Saturn under the name Angel Graffiti S. The player character is a high-school sophomore student, whose name, nickname, birth date and blood type is decided by the player at the beginning of the game. One day, while walking through the park, you notice a beautiful girl, but don't really manage to make a good impression on her and she soon goes away. The next day, your homeroom teacher announces you have a new student joining your class ... her name is Misuzu Amano ... the girl you met a day ago in the park. Your luck didn't completely run out as now you will have plenty of time to try and make an impression on her and possibly make her fall in love with you. But she is not the only girl in school that caught your eyes, so you will have to decide who is your person of interest and who you will try to woo. Luckily for you, you are not alone on your quest, you will have a help from heaven itself, an angel by the name Eve, who will often give you advice on girls' feelings.The basic gameplay is similar to visual novel style with dialogues and occasional selectable answers, but while you're in your room you'll be able to perform some other actions such as study, work part-time to earn some income, ask Eve for advice, set events on your calendar, join the school clubs and similar options. While dialogues use typical anime character style to represent characters, each of the main heroines also has a small figure-like character that represents her. They come in five different degrees of emotions between love and hate, the middle one being neutral, neither loving nor hating you. The game features animations for certain memorable events, while the dialogues mostly use static images with different postures. Voice-acting is included but is not complete, meaning even the heroines that talk during dialogues do not talk throughout all of their dialogues bust only some of them.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Aquanaut's Holiday</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-07-26</td><td>Sony Computer Entertainment of America</td><td>Artdink Corporation</td><td>Adventure</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Meditative / Zen</td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In this game, players are put into the role of a submersible to explore the ocean depths at their leisure.

Well, maybe not so simple. When you start your game, you have to build your mechanical gladiator; choosing the color, body, eyes and legs. While most of your starting choices are purely cosmetic, the legs you choose do slightly affect your game by changing the speed and mobility of your fighter, as well as its special attack.Once you've created your robotic brawler, it's time to start climbing the ranks. To progress, you have to fight the robot that's occupying the rank above yours. Once you beat them, you get to take an arm and then move up. The game continues on in this fashion until you've bested all of the other combatants. However, a few curve-balls are thrown your way as you climb the ladder. For starters, there are several different arms you can acquire; from swords and shields to cannons and lasers, and the more you use them, the faster and more effective (i.e. damaging) they are. On top of that, even so often a sort of "boss" robot is put in your way. These "bosses" use special weapons that only they have access to. Until you pound them into scrap and take them, that is. These weapons can be incredibly powerful if you stick with them, making the rest of the fighters, save number one, a breeze. As an added bonus, you can even save your cyber-combatant to a memory card and bring it to a friend's house for some one-on-one let's-see-who-has-the-best-robot fighting goodness!The arenas themselves are fairly basic, but they are varied, offering up different layout and obstacles to take cover behind or use to get the drop on your opponent. They also have ledges, and like most fighting games a ring-out means an instant loss. As for the fighting, it's simple, but effective. Square and circle attack with the left and right arms, X jumps and triangle triggers your special (which has to charge of course). Of course different weapons have different ranges and timing, which will also improve the more you use them.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Worms</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-08-07</td><td>Ocean Software Ltd.</td><td>Team17 Software Limited</td><td>Strategy</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td>Comedy, War</td><td>Artillery</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control, Multiple units/characters control</td><td>Turn-based</td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hitpoints and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around.Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends. There are a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which are affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, airstrikes, and utilities such as ropes and girders.There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the ground, and complex tunnels can be formed. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Battle Arena Toshinden 2 plus</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-08-09</td><td>TAKARA Co., Ltd.</td><td>Tamsoft Corporation</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td>Martial arts</td><td>Fighting</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Battle Arena Toshinden 2 plus is an updated version of Battle Arena Toshinden 2 for the game's re-release on Japan's "The Best" range (equivalent to the "Greatest Hits" and "Platinum" ranges in the U.S and E.U).It adds no new characters or attacks, rather it polishes and tweaks what is already there by enhancing the graphics (slightly sharper textures, particle effects replace sprite effects), tweaking character balance (with some attacks such as Fo's Mystic Sphere and Duke's Knight Strike having slightly new behaviour) and speed (the game runs notably faster than the Playstation version of the original game).Finally, the ability to save unlocked characters, scores and control setups has also been added (this was present in the PC version of Toshinden 2, but not in the Playstation version).</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Nanatsu no Hikan</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-08-09</td><td>KOEI Co., Ltd.</td><td>KOEI Co., Ltd.</td><td>Adventure</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td>Detective / mystery</td><td></td><td>Contemporary</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In this mystery adventure game, a young man called Ippei has been given the key to the seven mansions his uncle wants to restore and turn into a resort.

Carnby is now called upon to investigate a bootlegger named One Eyed Jack after an old detective colleague named Stryker attributes Jack to the kidnapping of young Grace Saunders. Stryker attempts to infiltrate Jack's dilapidated mansion of Hell's Kitchen and rescue the girl, only to disappear himself. That's where Carnby comes in.Carnby soon learns that Jack and his gangsters are really 15th-century pirates who gained immortality after Jack joined forces with Elizabeth Jarret, a Voodoo witch. However, the dark magic which keeps them immortal also requires Jack and his crew to regularly make human sacrifices (which explains Grace's kidnapping).Now Carnby must battle his way through Hell's Kitchen and Jack's army of Tommy-gun-wielding gangsters, searching for a way to break the spell and make them stay dead. Alone in the Dark 2 is an action-adventure game, similar to the original Alone in the Dark. Like its predecessor, the game uses hybrid 2D-3D graphics. Completing the game requires you to solve a lot of puzzles while fighting zombie pirates along the way. Some enemies can be killed with the numerous weapons at your disposal, while others need to be defeated via trickery. Apart from Edward Carnby, the game also includes a short section (two sections in the CD-ROM version) where you play as the little Grace Saunders. Grace obviously cannot fight, and thus the sections featuring her are all about fast reflexes and wits to evade and outsmart the enemies. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Creature Shock</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-08-23</td><td>Data East Corporation</td><td>Argonaut Software Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td>Horror</td><td>Rail shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The earth is overpopulated and mankind must find a second home.

It features all of the known characters of the series, such as the Red Arremer (who would get his own game series: Gargoyle's Quest). It also features items from the game, for example the armor icon, which is required for Arthur to move in this game. Not only does it have the most well known characters in the Ghosts 'N Goblins games, it also features remixed music of the series. As with the The Incredible Machine games, there are different kinds of puzzles, one of them even involves killing Arthur.

Its purpose is for preemptive strike on terrorist forces, but it also assists the self-defense force, eliminates state enemies, and even takes on private missions. They have experts with a wide range of expertise.Counter Revolution War is an turn-based strategy game similar to Front Mission. The player assembles a team of pilots each with their own characteristics, puts them in heavily armed mechs, and equips them with the best weapons government money can buy.

Then Ken (who is retired in a cave) is attacked by an henchmen of this martial arts school. After defeating him, Ken decides to investigate.The player watches the development of plot in long anime-like cutscenes and takes an active role only during the simple turn-based battles.

Sonic Wings Special is an enhanced and expanded port of Aero Fighters Special (Sonic Wings Limited in Japan), a coin-op shoot-'em-up with vertical scrolling. The original coin-op game uses altered levels, graphics and many features from Aero Fighters, Aero Fighters 2 and Aero Fighters 3. The home console version adds new characters and endings, new bosses, updated graphics and unlockable planes. There are also Time Attack and 2-player modes. The game uses a branching stage system, so it is impossible to see all levels in one sitting. There is a total of 14 playable characters and many different endings (some of which are reused from previous games in the series). Overall the game has a comic feel. As of Summer 2012, the Android version of Sonic Wings Special has only 4 playable characters with 4 endings and 9 stages. However, the publisher is planning to add further elements of the original version.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Toaplan Shooting Battle 1</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-08-30</td><td>Banpresto Co., Ltd.</td><td>Toaplan Co., Ltd.</td><td>Compilation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Toaplan Shooting Battle 1 is a compilation of two classic shooters by Toaplan: Tiger-Heli and Kyūkyoku Tiger (Twin Cobra).

Frank Baum, Yellow Brick Road concerns the player's attempt to thwart an invasion of the Emerald City by the Gnome King. Along the way s/he teams up with the tin man, lion, and eventually the scarecrow. Besides these, other recognizable figures from the books include Jack Pumpkinhead, the little Wizard of Oz, and Glinda, who, in the game, is queen of Oz. The game's structure is reminiscent of first-person adventures: the player interacts with the environment and manipulates inventory items to proceed. The puzzles, however, are kept to a minimum, since combat occupies a significant portion of the game, effectively turning it into a hybrid of adventure and small-scale real-time strategy.Battles usually occur as dictated by the plot. The player does not fight directly, but instead acts as a general to his/her companions. Each character has a quick but weak base attack or can use one of the items found throughout the game. Many of the items act differently depending on who uses them. For instance, the flute calls field mice into battle for the Tin Woodman, while it calls crows into battle for the Scarecrow.  The more powerful the item, the longer the downtime for the character who has used it before he can fight again. The enemies progress toward the companions' side of the battlefield at a constant pace.  If they reach them, the battle is lost, and the player must try again.  If instead the player manages to push them back off the far side of the field, the battle is won and the game progresses. Different enemies are more greatly affected by different weapon/character combinations, and immune against some. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Die Hard Trilogy</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-08-31</td><td>Fox Interactive, Inc.</td><td>Probe Entertainment Ltd.</td><td>Action, Racing / Driving</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td>Crime</td><td>Arcade, Rail shooter, Shooter</td><td>North America</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Die Hard Trilogy lets players guide New York cop John McClane through three arcade-style games based on each of the three Die Hard movies.  Each movie is represented through a totally different style, making this a "3 games in 1" style package. Die Hard is a third person action/adventure through thirty floors of the Nakatomi Tower high-rise. Terrorists have interrupted the company's Christmas party and taken hostages.  As McClane, the player must search for hostages through computer, construction, maintenance, and executive levels. McClane's default pistol holds infinite ammo, and the player can collect limited-ammo machine guns and grenades inside the levels. Walls turn transparent when they intersect the camera, allowing players to follow McClane through hallways and rooms with ease. After all the hostages on a level have been rescued, the player has 30 seconds to locate a bomb sent down by elevator, then use that elevator to move to the next level. Die Hard 2: Die Harder is a first-person arcade gun game, nearly identical to Virtua Cop. Terrorists have attacked Washington/Dulles Airport. The player automatically moves through the airport and surrounding areas "on rails," shooting bad guys that appear from behind the scenery.  Weapon upgrade icons can be shot to be collected, and either use limited ammo, or are retained until the player is hit (identical to Lethal Enforcers). Players can also destroy parts of the environment by shooting it, which can be used to take out nearby terrorists (with explosions, or by shooting overhead items to drop on them).  This game supports pad controls, or any of the PlayStation's gun controllers.  Die Hard With A Vengeance has players racing through New York City streets in a variety of vehicles, trying to locate bombs before they explode.  A strict timer ticks off the next explosion, and the player is guided only by a direction arrow and the vocal suggestions of their co-driver. Bombs are hidden inside everyday objects (like phone booths and benches) and are defused by ramming them, which activates the timer on the next bomb. Occasional "bomb cars" must be chased and rammed until their life bar is depleted. Powerups can be collected by running over icons in the streets, and include extra time, turbo boosts, and jumps to rocket over obstacles.All three games are exaggeratedly bloody (players can run over pedestrians in Die Hard 3 and wipe the blood away with windshield wipers). Each of the three games also uses a combination of textured polygons and sprites to generate their worlds, resulting in warping textures and some quirky "paper doll" effects.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">NFL Quarterback Club 97</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-08-31</td><td>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Iguana Entertainment Incorporated</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">NFL Quarterback Club 97 utilizes many of the same gameplay elements seen in Madden NFL 97 - including the kicking T-meter, the three-quarter overhead primary camera angle, and the button assignments and controls.

Contrary to the aforementioned title, you drive ordinary racing cars, if you count out the mounted weapons. These include mines, concussion missiles, smart bombs, heat-seeking missiles, lasers and firewalls. Some are provided by taking out enemies, but power-ups, time bonuses, energy, armor and a handicap that turns the screen upside-down, can also be collected.Five cars are available, with different statistics and built-in weapons. The initially weak weapon is soon replaced when you collect upgrade icons. To activate these, you have to complete a bonus stage after which you can also save your game. To add to the game's length, each of the twelve tracks, based on the settings "city", "mountain" or "space", has three variations: reverse, at night or the combination of the two. Other features include a small diagram showing approaching cars to time your mines, and pumping electronic tracks to match the game's pace.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">NHL Powerplay '96</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-09-01</td><td>Virgin Interactive Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Radical Entertainment Inc.</td><td>Sports</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">An early competitor to the EA Sports NHL series, NHL Powerplay '96 features motion-captured players, an NHL Player’s Association license, a variety of managerial options, and the ability to play seasons and tournaments.It is the first NHL game to include a World Tournament mode in which the NHL players can compete against each other on their respective national teams.In a time where developers tried to get the most from 32-bit consoles, leading to the "unlimited camera angles" blurb on many games, NHL Powerplay stuck with the one most people used, the overhead "behind the goal" view, popularized by EA's NHL series - and it was one of first full 3D sports games on the market.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">PGA Tour 97</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-09-01</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This golf game is another entry in the Electronic Arts PGA Tour Golf series.Players can choose to play as one of fourteen professional golfers such as Fuzzy Zoeller and Jim Gallagher Jr. or choose to create their own golfer by giving them a name and choosing what their golfer looks like from the few portraits that are available.Players are then able to select what type of game mode they want to play.

In Ranking mode the player enters a target amount to be reached and then plays against their opponents to see who can reach that amount. If a single player plays in this mode the game provides three opponents but the game caters for up to ten players with the game providing the additional AI opponents. Roulette,Video Poker,  and Slot Machines in this game mode are played within a split screen.
In Free mode there are no computer opponents and the games are the same as the games played in Ranking mode though there are minor differences, such as selecting which slot machine to play, because in this mode the split screen mode is not used at all.There are three kinds of slot machine which can be played for different stakes. Keno is the odd game here because it does not appear on the game menu, instead during any game other than Video Poker a casino hostess pops up in her own little window inviting the player to a game of Keno. If the player accepts they are shown a Keno card on which they mark their numbers after which their current game of Baccarat, Roulette or whatever resumes. A short while later the hostess window opens up again and the hostess gives the good, or more usually bad, news on how good their selections were.

Set in a high school, NiToshinden is, like its parents, a versus fighting game. It features four fighters and a fifth hidden character from the first two Toshinden Playstation games; Eiji, Sofia, Ellis and Tracy along with four exclusive characters based off school stereotypes; Ryuji, Rika, Baifu and Shu.As in the main series, the arenas are 3D and a sidestep manoeuvre exists for moving around them, but otherwise the gameplay is different from its parent series.Each character has the same six attacks; hard, medium, light, low, special attack and desperation; the differences between the fighters are in the range, speed of and what the attacks do for each fighter. For instance, Eiji's special attack is to shoot a carrot from his sword, a play on his classic fireball attack, while Sofia's special attack is a variant on her classic Aurora Revolution attack.The game features no standard combos or blocking. Instead a parry must be performed to block all non-low attacks. Low attacks are unblockable and have to be sidestepped. The characters also have the ability to dive under any non-low attack.An unusual element of the game is its "practice mode", which, unlike other fighting games, is a series of short videos hosted by an enthusiastic Japanese lady and a small CGI version of Rika.The art style heads further into the realms of anime than the other installments of the series, with cell-shaded textures and fighters with huge heads and small bodies.

However, the player must reach all possible endings with a girl, including the bad ones, before their true "happy end" will be unlocked.The gameplay itself is a basic QIX variant, where the player must use their cursor to capture the glowing silhouette of the female character without being hit by enemies. Several items will also appear to aid the player, such a speed booster, and a time stop. Each stage also has a random objective such as "collect every item" or "get 30% in one capture". Failing to complete the objective does not necessarily mean game over, and in many cases will result in a different story branch.Images from completed stages can be freely viewed from an in-game gallery, and completing all of a girl's story paths will unlock a bonus dress-up mode for that character where the player can swap out different outfits.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Tokimeki Memorial: Taisen Puzzle Dama</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-09-27</td><td>Konami Co., Ltd.</td><td>Konami Co., Ltd.</td><td>Puzzle</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Falling block puzzle</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Real-time</td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Tokimeki Memorial Taisen Puzzle Dama is a Puyo Puyo style puzzle game based on the dating game Tokimeki Memorial.

Through Myst Island, the game is further divided into mini-worlds set in different ages accessed through different books.

This virus creates a dimensional vortex that threatens to swallow the entire world. Stanley Opar, a member of S.A.V.E (Special Action for Virus Elimination) enters the vortex with one goal: destroy the virus before the universe ceases to exist.Time Commando is an action game with light puzzle-solving elements. The player character travels to eight different time periods: Prehistoric, Roman Empire, Feudal Japan, Medieval, Conquistador, Wild West, Modern Wars, and Future. Each era has its own characteristic enemies and sets of weapons: for example, Stanley fights with rocks and bone knives in the Prehistoric era, switching to shurikens and katanas in Japan, revolvers and shotguns in the Wild West, laser pistols in the future, etc. Most of the time in the game is spent fighting enemies. Character navigation and combat resemble those of Alone in the Dark. The navigation is character- rather than camera-based, similarly to survival horror games. During combat, Stanley has three attack moves at his disposal, as well as a blocking move. Part of the challenge relies on choosing the right weapons against particular enemies. Stanley starts with a small life bar that can be increased by picking up life power-ups, as well as multiple lives. Time limit is imposed on each level. To lower the countdown, the player has to deposit computer chips collected throughout the levels in special orb pools.

While overworld locations and battle screens in the game are isometric, the maze-like 3D dungeons are explored from a first-person perspective. Player-controlled characters fight randomly encountered demons in round-based combat, using melee weapons, firearms, or spells. As opposed to most other Megaten games, player-controlled party (up to five active combatants) consists entirely of human characters. Verbal communication with demons, however, still plays an important role in the game.Each character possesses a unique set of four communication styles, e.g. insult, flattery, etc. The player may select combinations of various characters and their approaches during conversation with the demon. Depending on the player's choices, as well as the current Moon Phase, the demon may end up responding in one of the four emotional ways: anger, fear, joy, and interest. The last two types responses are beneficial to the player: the demon may give the party a useful item or a spell card.If the player combines various types of spell cards, more powerful creatures (Personae) can be fused in a special location called Velvet Room. Personae act like equipment sets and can be attached to player characters, modifying their parameters, strengths and weaknesses, and teaching them new spells.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Saban's Power Rangers Zeo: Full Tilt Battle Pinball</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-10-01</td><td>Bandai America, Inc.</td><td>KAZe Co., Ltd.</td><td>Simulation</td><td>Top-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Pinball</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Pinball, a game that has been around since the 1930s, has been translated into video game format once again, this time via the Mighty Morphing Power Rangers, those multi-colored ninja heroes of low-budget television.

Your goal is to build a skyscraper that is both tall, aesthetically pleasing, popular, and, most importantly, economically profitable. To be successful, your building cannot just be endless levels of office space or purely an apartment sky-rise, but rather a multi-functional haven for humanity featuring everything from penthouses to theatres, restaurants to shopping malls. The centerpiece of your tower design is your elevators and proper management is key.You can watch your Sims enter and leave your grand tower, getting impatient waiting for elevators, or having a hectic workday at the office. You can even train in on one or two, to serve as a metering stick for their compatriots, or just to peek into the average workday of the little people living in your building. Or watch the security and rescue crews race as disasters like bomb threats and fires rampage through your well-crafted skyscraper.The PlayStation version adds an additional bonus map.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Space Jam</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-11-01</td><td>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Sculptured Software, Inc.</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other), Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Based on the movie of the same name, Space Jam centres around an invasion of Looney Tunes land by tiny aliens. The fate of the Tunes is to be decided by a basketball game, and for this the aliens turn into the huge, evil Monstars.The game is about two thirds basketball sim and then minigames are stuck in to fill all the gaps. You can play as the Monstars or the Looney Tunes who have the help of Michael Jordan. The basketball games themselves come in two flavours, two-on-two and three-on-three.Successful completion of the minigames upgrades your character's abilities on the court. There are several - one involves finding MJ's basketball togs, one is a space race in the style of the retro Micro Machines games. There are about five minigames in all, and a player from both teams participates.The multiplayer is a big aspect of the game. There is the traditional two-player versus, one team Tunes, one team Monstars, and there is also co-operative mode. In this two or even three players can play on the same team. Using multitaps, you can actually have a three-on-three game.The Tunes roster is made up of Michael Jordan, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Lola Bunny, Taz, Foghorn Leghorn, Pepé Le Pew, Sylvester, Wile E. Coyote, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam. The Monstars have access to Pound, Bupkus, Bang, Blanko and Nawt.There are three statistics in the game, namely Speed, Shooting and Rebounds. These are pretty self-explanatory, but there is another more subtle one that's similar to stamina. Throughout the course of play your characters will get tired and lose their focus. A successful slam dunk usually tops this up.The closest thing the game has to a single player mode is the Intergalactic Tournament (though it can be played multiplayer). This is a series of five matches in a row. One captain is picked and plays every game, while the rest of the team is substituted in and out.There is no real way to progress in the game as it does not support memory cards. Space Jam has more of an arcade, lighthearted feel to it.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Star Gladiator: Episode:I - Final Crusade</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-11-01</td><td>Capcom Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Capcom Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td>Fighting</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Set in the 24th Century, this 3D fighter pits humans against humanoids. Combo systems and counter attacks are all there, as well as some strange characters, especially Saturn who uses two yo-yos as his main weapon.The back story to the game has humanity exploring the stars, populating planets and meeting alien races. Not all races are friendly so in 2348 the Federation starts researching a new plasma power weapon. The chap leading the research is Dr. Edward Bilstein and he discovers human's sixth sense that taps the power of the human mind. The weapon works and is a success but it is discovered that Bilstein has used real people in his experiments so he is exiled and all further work stops.Move on four years and, thanks to rumours about the Federations super weapon hostile confrontations have largely ceased and everyone is getting along, then a small band of rebels calling themselves 'The Fourth Empire' attacks and wipes out an army base. It looks like Bilstein is heading towards Earth for revenge so the army puts together a team of people who can use the plasma force weapon to mount a last ditch defense of the planet.The game has the following modes of play:Arcade Mode: In which the player selects a character and fights their way through all the other computer controlled characters. It's a one player game mode but a second player can join in at any time.
Vs. Mode: This is a two payer contest where players select a character each, fight each other, then return to the character selection screen. Here the players can adjust the skill levels of their characters to even up their handicaps, the default setting is 'Random'.
Group Battle Mode: This mode allows one or two players to play teams of up to five characters in a series of one round matches. This mode can be played as Player vs Player, Player vs CPU, or watch a demo with CPU vs CPU.
Training Mode: because practice makes perfectGame configuration options allow the player to set the CPU opponents difficulty, the Damage that the players attach can be caused, the Time limit for each round, the number of rounds for each match, configure the keypad buttons, and there's a shortcut option to skip some of the setup screens in Vs. Mode.There are eight characters in the game, Hayato - a Japanese bounty hunter; June Lin Milliam - whose an English gymnast with a hatred for Bilstein because he was responsible for her father's death; Saturn - an alien street performer from Saturn with a passion for street theatre; Gamof - a lumberjack turned bounty hunter from Andromeda; Gerelt - a Spanish matador who was recruited the Fourth Empire; Vector a prototype robot assassin member of the Fourth Empire; Rimgal - part human, part Tyrannosaurus who fights for the Fourth Empire because he has a microchip implanted in his brain; Zelkin - a Klondike warrior king who owes a debt of honour to Bilstein; Gore Gajah from Indonesia who specialises in black magic; and finally Dr. Edward Bilstein.Characters special moves in this game are called Plasma Combos and they are triggered by putting together a series of basic attacks. There are three types Plasma Combos, Hayato and Gerelt have Type A  combos, Gamof, Saturn, Vector and Gore have Type B, and Zelkin, Rimgal and June have Type K. There's also a Plasma Final attack which becomes available if, after the fifth Plasma Combo, the player executes a special attack followed by pressing a specific direction button (the manual does not say what these are - it's up to the player to work it out)</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Star Wars: Dark Forces</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-11-01</td><td>LucasArts Entertainment Company LLC</td><td>LucasArts Entertainment Company LLC</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Kyle Katarn is a former Imperial officer turned mercenary, now hired by the Rebel Alliance. After having stolen the Death Star plans from a remote facility, he is tasked with investigating the sudden destruction of a hidden Rebel base. This leads him to face off against Imperial General Rom Mohc and the various iterations of his Dark Troopers - cybernetic soldiers with the armor and firepower to turn the tide of the war.Dark Forces is a close prequel to the original Star Wars movie trilogy. The game marks LucasArts' first attempt to enter the first-person shooter market. Instead of licensing the DOOM engine, like many competitors, LucasArts created its own internal Jedi engine. The Jedi engine contains advanced features over similar tech, including the ability to look up and down, jump, crouch, and limited support (in the build used for Dark Forces) for rooms (sectors) over rooms. The 3D models also make occasional appearances inside the game, as turrets or Kyle's ship dropping him off or picking him up from each mission. Most levels have a fairly complex, often maze-like structure, and include various switches that need to be activated to change the layout of the level. Jumping is integrated into the gameplay, as certain areas can only be accessed in that way. In addition to weapons, Kyle can use shields to protect himself from damage, a head lamp to illuminate dark areas, as well as specific items used to counter environmental hazards. The player character is given a certain amount of "lives" per level; he dies permanently once he runs out of all of them. Game progress can be saved only between missions.The game features fourteen substantial levels as Kyle works to disarm the Dark Trooper project. Many levels reference characters or areas from the Star Wars movie trilogy, such as a visit with Jabba the Hutt, a trip to Coruscant, and a battle through the interior of a Star Destroyer. As opposed to most first-person shooters of the time period, every level has objectives for Kyle to complete, ranging from grabbing a clue and getting out alive, to planting charges around a facility to demolish it.  Cutscenes appear between key missions to update the plot.The Star Wars license gets plenty of use, as the game features imperial officers, stormtroopers, and a collection of aliens seen in the films as enemies. Blaster rifles and thermal detonators are used as weapons, along with other firearms inspired by the tech of the films. Dark Forces also uses the iMuse engine to dynamically change the music during action scenes, with much of the music based off or directly replicating, John Williams' original film score.The game is entirely a single-player campaign; no multiplayer is included or supported.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Tecmo's Deception</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-11-01</td><td>Tecmo, Inc.</td><td>Tecmo, Ltd.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG), Strategy</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td>Horror</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Real-time</td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Once upon a time, there was a prince who wanted nothing else out of life but marry his sweetheart Fiana and live happily ever after. But his fate took an unexpected turn when his malicious brother Yurias killed their father, the king, and framed the prince for murder in order to get Fiana for himself. Possessed by despair, the prince's soul could not rest in peace. The prince made a pact with Satan himself, and was given the Castle of the Damned, where he would set traps to capture souls, grow stronger, and eventually get his revenge...Deception is a first-person perspective game that has elements of strategy and role-playing. The main activity in the game is setting traps for those who dare to venture into the castle, which requires magic points. Captured invaders can be dealt with in various ways. They can be released, killed, or have their soul devoured. The game registers the prince's deeds with a morality system: killing innocent people who just happen to be inside the castle would lower the morality level of the protagonist. Devouring the souls increases the hero's parameters, similarly to experience points in RPGs. Money can be obtained from corpses and spent on expanding the castle. Body parts can be used to create and summon monsters, who would help the owner to stop invaders. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Tempest X3</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-11-01</td><td>Interplay Entertainment Corp.</td><td>High Voltage Software, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Tempest X3 is a modern-day update to the original arcade game, Tempest.

There are in fact two stories in the game, featuring two different characters, who live in different provinces of the Empire. The boy Wallace enjoys a peaceful life with his family in a quiet village; the girl Rakjit witnesses persecution and death of her mother, and joins a resistance movement that specializes in magics. The paths of the two young people will eventually lead to the same goal - the liberation of the world; but when and how it will be achieved, remains unclear...The game plays for the most part like a traditional Japanese-style top-down RPG. Both Wallace and Rakjit eventually gather a party, which roams the world, visiting various locations and advancing the story in a predominantly linear fashion. The appearance of random enemies triggers a battle screen, which is viewed from an isometric perspective. The battle system is rather old-fashioned, with physical and magical attacks; level progression is automatic, as in most games of the genre.Sometimes the game prompts the player to choose an action or a response; while the flow of the story is rarely influenced by the player's decision, the game keeps track of these decisions, evaluating the player's attitude between chapters.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">First Queen IV</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-12-06</td><td>Kure Software Koubou</td><td>Kure Software Koubou</td><td>Role-playing (RPG), Strategy</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td>Real-time</td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The land of Logris was originally inhabited by elves, dwarves, and other magical creatures. When the humans arrived, the cultural differences between the races were not enough to provoke a war, so for a while they co-existed peacefully. Afterwards, the humans have split into several smaller nations. The nation of Barcia in the north had a small population, and its king Zenel was worried his country would be conquered by others. To prevent that, he invited the dark magician Zon, who cast a spell over his soldiers. But nothing comes without a price. Insanity seized the king and its army. Barcia began invading other countries. A warrior named Ares and his friends try to assassinate the king, but as a result, Ares is thrown in prison. A mysterious man with magical powers saves Ares, telling him that it's time to sort out the differences between nations and races, and lead an army to stop the madness of Barcia...The fourth entry in the  First Queen series utilizes the trademark "mixed-up characters" battle system, with dozens of characters on both sides fighting each other in real time. The game features a new point-and-click interface, with battle tactics accessible at any moment from the battle screen. It is also possible to focus attacks on an enemy simply by clicking on him with the mouse. Compared to the previous entries, First Queen IV emphasizes the war game aspect, with less focus on RPG-like exploration and more strategic challenge. The movement on the map has grown into an important gameplay device: different armies move simultaneously, and the player has to pay attention to enemy forces advancing to different locations. It is possible to split units, create new ones, exchange soldiers, and send different units to different locations. An enemy army may join forces with the heroes upon defeat; diplomacy can also be used to make agreements with sovereign city-states. Once a location is clear of enemies, it is possible to "camp" and to direct other actions from there.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Fluid</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-12-06</td><td>Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.</td><td>Opus Corp.</td><td>Simulation</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Music / rhythm</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">A unique Interactive Sound Lab that enables you to compose infinite music sequences covering all genres of dance music.

A total of 24 ingenious puzzles must be solved, each independent of the others. Most of them can be played in two difficulty levels (Easy or Hard), and the Oracle provides clues to help along the way.The graphics for the puzzles are designed in an Egyptian or Mesopotamian style. Music plays in the background to provide atmosphere, but it can be turned off, if it gets repetitive. The basic layout is a hexagon around an Oracle's well. There are three doors on the outside of the hexagon, and the first one is where you begin the game. In each room is a puzzle you have to solve to get a jewel which must be taken back to the Oracle's well.The puzzles in this game can be compared to those found in The 7th Guest.  The Chinese Checkers puzzle in Shivers rivals many of the ones contained in Jewels of the Oracle.  </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Kid Klown in Crazy Chase 2: Love Love Hani Soudatsusen</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-12-06</td><td>Kemco</td><td>Kemco</td><td>Action</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Kid Klown in Crazy Chase 2: Love Love Hani Soudatsusen  is the sequel to the SNES title Kid Klown in Crazy Chase.

Races can be entered by one or two players and involve eight horses struggling for victory; each of the eight horses (in the order which the game presents them in: White Heat, Hot Sand, Euro Union, Asian Hope, Brave Lady —the sole female one—, Be Silent, US Fighter, Sky Dancer) given for selection is characterized by three parameters (named «abilities» in-game): speed, stamina, strength, all measured in stars from a minimum of one to a maximum of five. Rival horses are not available for selection to the player: their names are, for instance, the ominous- or hilarious-sounding «Mr Devious», «Red Vision», «Sunk Star», «HelpMe», «OhMygod», «Nutseater». The names are also differentiated by being written all in capital letters the latter ones, normally the former.Before the beginning of the race, while horses approach the starting point, the name of the circuit, course plan, prize money and circuit time record are displayed. During the race, the indicators on the screen are: the course plan (with a moving coloured circular indicator representing the position of each contender), the chronometric indication of time, the horse's energy bar with a line composed of three segments beside it: a red one (that means the horse is in its full strength), a yellow and a blue one (denoting lack of strength); a representation of the horse's face, which portrays its, more or less fatigued or strong status and how intensely it is running.The game controls require the use of two buttons and the control stick or directional pad: one button controls the reins, for slight acceleration, which consumes a little of the horse's energies. The other one controls the whip, for sharp acceleration: this consumes the horse's force significantly. Should the energy be consumed entirely, racing will have to be given up for a while. Two rapid touches on the joystick or directional pad in the direction of travel allow to force away a horse blocking the player's road to victory; two rapid touches in the direction opposite to that of travel vigorously reduce speed. Power-up items represented by icons placed on the course may be taken during the race, raising one of the parameters of the horse by one for some time, giving a temporary boost in speed, or partially restoring the horse. Weather conditions change from time to time: the drizzle may be an obstacle, worsening the status of the terrain. A real second corresponds to two seconds in game (therefore, for instance, a one-minute race will last half a minute).After every stage, the track length, as well as the prize money awarded to the first three finishers are augmented. The series of levels are separated by training stages. If done successfully, training on the dirt or on the turf respectively increases the horse's stamina and speed, whereas training on or «against»,the hill strengthens it. Success in training session is to be attained by pushing a button as rapidly as possible, while avoiding assorted obstacles and hindrances. The player can choose what type of training to opt for.Race courses proceed in the ensuing sequence: 
Maidens
Sapporo Juvenile
Juvenile Stakes
training
2000 Guineas
Derby Stakes (the $1.300.000 prize money is mistakenly displayed as «$ 130.000»)
St. Leger (BC Classic in the original arcade game)
training
Japan Grandprix
Emperor Spring Cup
Champion Stakes
St. Leger  (difficulty is now higher than the previous time)

The Arc The TriompheThe game is identical to the original one in all of its fundamental aspects, save for a number of modifications to minor details: continues are still named «credits» (four of them are given: it is possible to select a different horse when continuing the game using a credit after game over) and their quantity is indicated, likewise in arcade games, at the bottom of the screen (although the flashing «Insert coin» on the opening screen followed by «Push P1 start !» has been replaced with «Push P1 or P2 start !»).While the original game was entirely in Japanese (except for race names, given an English translation), the console version, despite not having been released outside of Japan, can be said to be in English (conversely, now race course names have a Japanese translation next to the English name); money prizes are now in dollars rather than in yen, and remarkably changed in value: whereas YPN 5300 were the reward in the arcade version, $540000 are awarded to the winner of a race. Initially, nothing but crossing the finish line in the first place allowed progression in the game; in the console conversion finishing in the first three places guarantees advancement to the next race.Horse energy is named «power» in the Neo Geo version, adhering to the original game, while in the Wii version it was renamed to «life»; furthermore, in the Neo Geo version the blue and red segments are shown inverted beside the energy bar. The console version presents fours levels of difficult: easy, normal, hard, MVS.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">The Incredible Hulk: The Pantheon Saga</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-12-12</td><td>Eidos, Inc.</td><td>Attention to Detail Limited</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Beat 'em up / brawler</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The Incredible Hulk is an isometric 3D action game.The popular Marvel comic book hero The Hulk returns to the PC, Playstation and Saturn systems to battle tons of lowly enemies and the occasional monstrous super-villain. When the lawful Pantheon society of superheroes kidnaps the green giant, he joins forces with his abductors and smashes through 13+2 isometric 3D levels (in a look reminiscent of the Loaded series of games).True to the comic books, the Hulk relies on no other weapons than his massive muscles to punch, kick and crush his enemies. When he has accumulated enough gamma energy, he may use powerful special moves like a Vortex Spin or the Floor Hammer. Rare bonus items also allow the Hulk to summon one of the four Pantheon team members Atalanta, Ulysses, Ajax and Hector to assist in the thick of battle. Most levels include at least one arch-enemy, such as Piecemeal, Trauma & Lazarus or the U-Foes. Luckily, the Hulk’s regenerative powers allow him to regain health slowly. Little seems to be left of the Hulk’s legendary leaping capacity, however, so the green meat ball is forced to hop from platform to platform every now and then.

The player moved to a new town and is living with his younger sister. The story progresses in a typical visual novel style where one reads onscreen text, talks to present characters and moves from location to location in a determined order. Free movement is not done directly on a map but is rather scheduled. During school and lunch breaks the player can schedule places on school campus he wishes to visit, and after school additional scheduling of the place around the town can be selected. Depending on place one visits, the location will have different girls to talk to, or if noone and the player will soon leave the place without engaging in any dialogue with anyone.The game uses full voice acting for main heroines but not all characters, and character animations are done at minimal with variation in static poses and dispositions. Upon creating the protagonist by entering his name (or leaving the default one) and setting up some of his parameters, the game will prompt the player to select the season during which the story will take place. Story itself will not change, and neither will most of the dialogues, but the outfit heroines and characters will change to fit the selected season (they may wear short shirts during summer or winter jacket during winter season). Finishing the game unlocks bonus extras which can be accessed via main menu.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Yusha: Heaven's Gate</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-12-13</td><td>Atlus Co., Ltd.</td><td>Racdym</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Fighting</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Yusha: Heaven's Gate is a 3D fighting game with an arcade and Vs. mode.

The internet has grown to be an enormously important part of life, and a digital world called "Cyberland" has come into existence. This digital world is divided into eight levels, with more important and confidential information being granted higher levels of priority, with the highest levels being inaccessible to anyone other than those with the highest government security clearance.A young junior-high student named Alice Minazuki is the daughter of one of the developers of this system. He left her with a very special "dive system," which allows the user to enter the deepest parts of Cyberland. Together with her friends Rena Ohtori and Juri Yagami, they are ALICE-3, a team tasked with maintaining peace and order in Cyberland.Alice in Cyberland is a traditional Japanese-style adventure game divided into chapters. Each chapter begins with Alice and her friends in Tokyo, and you can move about the city talking to people to find out more about what's happening. Eventually, she'll need to "dive" into Cyberland, which is also represented by a city. Your team will be able to move around, investigating different systems and looking for information, and eventually running into enemy "guard programs" which must be fought. The battle system is simple, allowing for either attack, defense, and character change. Defeating a guard system will continue the story.While exploring Tokyo, you can also visit an arcade and play a game, or go to a Karaoke club and watch the girls sing. The game's scenario was written by Chiaki Konaka, better known for his work on serial experiments lain, The Big O, and Ultraman.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Arcade's Greatest Hits: The Atari Collection 1</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-12-20</td><td>Midway Home Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Atari, Inc.</td><td>Compilation</td><td></td><td></td><td>Earwax Productions</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Another in the series of Midway's retro arcade compilations, this is the first to feature early Atari titles (in addition to the usual FMV interview segments.)The games included are:

You alone survived. It is clear that the Silencer is being silenced... and the only place to turn is the Resistance... Crusader: No Remorse is the first in the series, which is best described as a 2D isometric shooter. Your silencer can roll left, roll right, kneel, jump, run, and perform other acrobatic moves. You get plenty of different weapons, from assault rifles and shotguns to grenade launchers and lasers, to really exotic weapons like microwave cannon, EMP discharger, and even plasma cannons. You're up against the full military might of the WEC, from simple guards to full-fledged Guardmechs and elite forces (though none are quite as good as you). You can find supplies and money off of killed enemies (if you left a body, that is, and some of the extreme weapons don't). You'll often need to bypass traps, open doors, disable alarms, take out security cameras, and more. The action is intense, and there's usually a bit of puzzle involved. It's often a matter of exploring the map to find a switch or a terminal with the code that'll let you access another part or another level of the map. Between missions you can chat in the Resistance base and/or buy/sell weapons. You can also find recharge stations to replenish your energy and health (you can also find batteries and first aid kits too).

It retains the same gameplay and humorous elements that substantiated the first two games. Gameplay itself is a parody of Konami's famous Gradius series; the screen scrolls from left to right (most times) and the player manoeuvres a flying character around the screen destroying waves of enemies and avoiding obstacles. Unlike previous Parodius titles, this game contains a difficulty adjustment option, allowing the player to make things easier or harder. Also unique to this installment are bits of digital voice acting. Survival throughout the level leads the player to a boss fight, which frequently includes some of the strangest characters in the game. Power-ups include, besides the standard version (red, used to upgrade weapons), the shield power-up (blue) and a variety of different coloured bells. Green Bells will make the protagonist huge on the screen; Yellow Bells are worth points (points in turn are worth extra lives); Blue Bells are "big bombs" that clear the screen of enemies and can be saved until you need them; White Bells will give the player character a megaphone that will shout out phrases that damage enemies; Red Bells stockpiles the hero with three point-defense lasers, only one of which can be activated at a time and disappears after a short while; Purple Bells will clear the screen of all but the strongest enemies, turning them into power-ups.This time around there are sixteen different characters to chose from, each with unique power-ups and weapons. These include familiar faces from earlier games as well as new ones: Vic Viper, the "gradius ship" equipped with its traditional Gradius weapons; Pentaro from Penguin Adventure, whose Potion weapon may now hit multiple enemies and his normal weapon shots explode against obstacles; Soitsu, a green stickman surfing aboard a paper airplane, whose laser weapon is able to charge up to deliver more power and who drops little stickmen onto the ground which occasionally dance around rather than attacking; Mike, a cute little kitten who happens to to have a very powerful wave weapon which can travel through obstacles and enemies, as well as a multiple bomb ability which requires his "upgrade ability"; Memim, a flying fairy in bikini who carries missile weapons whose direction is determined by her current location on the screen when fired; Tako, the flying octopus wearing a baseball cap; Upa, the flying baby with a Mega Crush ability that destroys all enemies on screen, and others.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Lightning Legend: Daigo no Daibōken</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-12-20</td><td>Konami Co., Ltd.</td><td>Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other), Side view</td><td></td><td>Martial arts</td><td>Arcade, Fighting</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The ancient country of Japon has existed for millennia, through times of peace and war.

The single-player story mode allows the player to choose from one of eight characters who are each traveling around Japon for their own personal reasons. Extended dialogue sequences before and after each battle drive the story. There is also a two-player versus mode.The fighting system is comparable to other contemporary fighting games, such as Super Street Fighter II and Dead or Alive. Each character has their own set of standard and special moves, executed by various button commands. Each character also has unique special moves that can be used when their power meter is filled.

The protagonist is equipped with a gun, giving the player some modicum of defense agains the lizard people and giant spiders that inhabit the caves they're exploring, and they can also kick enemies. Aside from simple combat, players will also sometimes be faced with multiple-choice options of how to proceed.

The gameplay can be described as playing Resident Evil but without the monsters. The slapstick humor is still intact with more explosions, trapdoors, shower scenes and a laugh track when Keaton gets into any of these traps. The game also adds voice acting for the dialogues. None of the traps are lethal so players can enjoy seeing how Keaton gets squished, smashed, trips and falls and can't progress to a new area without pulling the necessary levers.

Now in New Horizons, it is the early 16th century and the age of exploration and sea trade is underway. Players choose from any one of six adventurers (scenarios), each with their own distinctive but intertwining plot, to embark on a quest of sailing, seamanship and exploration. The six characters are:João Franco is the son of Duke Leon Franco, the hero of the first Uncharted Waters game and an influential man in Portugal. His father wants to make him into a strong man and so decides to send him out to sea. Young Joao is tasked with learning the skills of the sailor (he is the only character who starts at level one) and embarking on a quest of discovery; reaching the far east and eventually looking for the secret of Atlantis.
Catalina Erantzo is a Spanish naval officer who believes her beloved and her brother were both murdered by the Portuguese armada. Vowing revenge she turns to a life of piracy and soon becomes a red haired scourge of the seas.
Pietro Conti is a indebted man, having inherited the financial woes of the Conti family. When the Duchess Franco hires him to spy on her son, he accepts the job and obtains a ship. Pietro hopes to use these resources to seek out valuable treasure and clear up his family's debt.
Ernst Von Bohr is a geographer who is teaching classes in Holland. He yearns to leave the classroom and sail the high seas, living a life of adventure that he has only read about in books. When his friend, Mercator offers to finance his initial voyage in exchange for cartography information about the world, Ernst is given the opportunity to live out his dream.
Ali Vezas is a poor orphaned child living in Istanbul and serving others. He dreams of becoming his own master and making his own fortune across foreign lands. A twist of fate aides in providing him with small loans, with which he is able to afford his first ship and sail out with a cargo hold full of goods...
Otto Baynes styles himself a Royal Knight of the British Empire, in the service of his majesty the king. Promoted to Admiral of the British fleet, the kingdom is worried about the increased naval power of Spanish fleets. Otto is given a letter of marque by the king and ordered to terrorize the Spanish Fleet. Equipping himself simply at first, Otto strives to become a great privateer in the name of king and country.Regardless of the character chosen, Uncharted Waters: New Horizons is a top-down sailing simulation. At sea, players control the direction of their ship, where speed is affected by the number/health of the crew, the wind and the currents. Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a port, the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings, each with unique services and goods. These include: the Inn, the Item Shop, the Shipyard, the Tavern, the Castle, the Guild Hall, the Church, the Merchant and the Harbor. It's up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are through sea trade, accepting jobs from the guild, gambling and battle with other ships.During naval combat, the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game, with the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons at enemy ships, or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the player's flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet, they can challenge the opponent to a duel. If accepted, the game changes to a side-view of the two captains engaged in a fight. During this sequence, the player can only choose which fighting maneuver (strike, thrust, parry, lash) they wish to engage in.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Tasogare no Ode: Ode to the Sunset Era</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-12-27</td><td>Tonkinhouse</td><td>Tonkinhouse</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Japanese-style RPG (JRPG)</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td>Direct control, Menu structures</td><td>Real-time, Turn-based</td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Tasogare no Ode: Ode to the Sunset Era is a JRPG in Japanese.

There are three kinds of combat in the game, the most common one being the traditional turn-based party combat (players can have up to six people in their active party). Magic runes can be equipped on the player's characters which allow limited usage of offensive and healing spells. There are also a few army battles, where the player must control whole units of fighters, archers, magicians, etc., and one-on-one fights (duels).The game allows the player to build and customize a castle, which serves as their home base and fortress. 108 characters can be recruited in the game, a tribute to 108 Stars Of Destiny in "Water Margins". Many of those characters will be available as active party members and participate in battles, while others will act as strategy advisers, or enhance the castle itself in various ways.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">4-4-2 Soccer</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997</td><td>Virgin Interactive Entertainment (Europe) Ltd.</td><td>Arc Developments</td><td>Sports</td><td>Diagonal-down, Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">4-4-2 Soccer is a football game with real teams and players.

Though many of the Organization counterparts have near identical move lists to their equivalent starting character.The arenas have been redesigned so that they are now enclosed allowing the ability to send the opponent flying into a wall or the ceiling, though the opponent can recover and use the wall for a counter attack.The combo system has been redesigned again; now each character has a preset range of combo's, however multiple combo's and special moves can now be combined to juggle the opponent for multiple hits, though once again the opponent can recover and counter your combo. The game's physics have been greatly relaxed to accommodate the new arenas and game play; many attacks launch the opponent clean across the arena.The North American and European versions of Toshinden 3 feature a slightly different blocking setup compared to the Japanese version. In the Japanese version there are separate high and low blocks, whereas in the Western versions the high block has been altered to be an all purpose block and will block both high and low automatically.

However, the recent actions of the king make even the most loyal of his subordinates doubt his judgment. The captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to attack the city of Mysidia and take the Water Crystal from innocent magicians who protect it. When Cecil questions the king's orders, he is immediately thrown out of the country and sent off to deliver a package to the village of Mist, accompanied by his best friend Kain, the captain of the dragoons. Little does he realize that the king's inexplicable behavior is but a part of a much larger picture, which he is yet to reveal.The fourth entry in the Final Fantasy series was released as Final Fantasy II in the West, because the second and the third games were not released there at the time. The game is a Japanese-style RPG with top-down world map navigation, automatic leveling up, and random enemy encounters.The game introduces a system called ATB (active-time battle). While combat is turn-based in its core, the game does not pause when the player accesses the battle menu. Enemies continue to act in real time regardless of the actions of the player-controlled party. The turns of the participants are calculated depending on their agility rating. Each player-controlled character has a special bar that gradually refills itself; said character may act when the bar is full.Unlike all the previous Final Fantasy games, the fourth installment does not allow the player to customize the characters' abilities and classes. Each character belongs to a specific, clearly defined class: dragoon, white mage, black mage, summoner, ninja, etc. Each of these classes has distinct special abilities or magic spells.

However, the game gains a new dimension in the "arcade mode", where it's possible to bend the rules with infamous kicks to the head or unleash the trademark move of the series - the Predator Megakick, named after the then revolutionary boot models. However, doing those decrease the players' stamina meter, and after the bar is depleted, players not only no longer can make special moves, but also take longer to recover from a tackle, so longer games can be won (or lost) by the number of players that can't feel their legs no more.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">hyper 3-D Pinball</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-01-01</td><td>Virgin Interactive Entertainment (Europe) Ltd.</td><td>NMS Software Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Pinball</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Tilt! is a pinball game.

One of the aspects of this game that set it aside from other games at this time was the variety of the terrain.  Not only is it off-road, but the course is filled with jumps, dips, hairpins, and off camber turns.   Consequently, it is very common for the car to flip upside down.  By pressing the shoulder buttons, the player can rock the car left or right.  To get back on the tires, the user must time the rocking of the car to flip it back upright.  Any of the course can be raced forwards or backwards, and there is a season mode as well as the single race mode.  In order to increase the chaos, there is a suicide-mode where you race the course in the opposite direction of the other cars.  Up to 4 players can play the game in split screen mode.  Tracks include a tight Stadium course, an abandoned mine, jungle, and desert.  One trick to increase performance is that the buttons that rock the car upright, can also be used to prevent flipping in tight corners. Mud, dirt, snow, and water are kicked up behind the car to add some graphical flair.  The cars in the game are not licensed vehicles.

The controls reflect this, with moving the controller to the right actually moving the character down and right, moving it down and right moving the character down directly, and so on. Each level is played out against a time limit, and the paths through the level aren’t always clear-cut. There are four different types of doors, each of which needs a particular icon to pass (the icons represent the door type, such as ice or bricks, rather than hot water or a key, or anything you’d logically expect to clear the path). You can avoid the baddies, which may be the best option, as killing them costs you some energy –this reduces the significance of the points system.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Dragon Knight 4</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-02-07</td><td>Banpresto Co., Ltd.</td><td>Elf Co., Ltd.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG), Strategy</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td>Adult</td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Dragon Knight 4 is a sequel to Knights of Xentar.

However, he is haunted by ghostly dreams that warn him of great danger in Britannia. The Avatar decides to travel there once again. Upon his arrival, he witnesses the kidnapping of Baron Almric's daughter. Found guilty of the crime, the Avatar is thrown into the Great Stygian Abyss with the choice of either finding the girl or rotting in the dungeon. On his journey, he will have to get along with the many inhabitants of the dungeon, who are survivors of a failed colony, and eventually find out that there's much more to this kidnapping than meets the eye.Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss is commonly considered the first role-playing game with fluid first-person movement in a real 3D environment. Unlike earlier first-person RPGs such as Dungeon Master or Eye of the Beholder, the player can move in every direction and the graphics are updated continually. The player is also able to look up and down with the press of a key, jump, and swim. The dungeon is not made entirely of corridors and rooms arranged in a rectangular fashion but has a lot of variety: slopes, stairs, bridges, underground rivers, and more.The game's combat system is action-oriented. The player has to draw his weapon, aim at his opponent, and hold the cursor over the game screen to inflict damage; the longer the player holds it, the stronger is the attack. Some weapons have different types of attacks, depending on where the cursor is held: for example, jabs are executed when the cursor is near the bottom of the screen, while slashes are performed with the cursor in the middle.At the beginning of the game, the player chooses the gender, the class, and the initial skills for the Avatar. Skills include various weapon proficiencies, lockpicking, bartering, and others. They can be increased by reciting mantras at special shrines after having accumulated a sufficient amount of experience points. Leveling up also increases the Avatar's hit points and mana. The magic system is based on runes that can be found in the Abyss. If combined in the right order, they produce a magical effect. As the Abyss is populated by more than just monsters, there are various conversations the Avatar can conduct with non-playable characters. The player can also make choices regarding the Avatar's behavior towards these characters. Game progression is largely non-linear: the player is able to explore most of the Abyss in any order, though several specific tasks must be accomplished in order to complete the story.  An auto-map displays all the locations the player has explored previously, and also allows the player to make notes on it.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Mega Man Battle &amp; Chase</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-03-20</td><td>Capcom Co., Ltd.</td><td>Capcom Co., Ltd.</td><td>Racing / Driving</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade</td><td></td><td>Automobile, Track racing, Vehicle simulator</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">It's robot mayhem at the Battle & Chase tournament!

Much like the first in the series, the sequel has plenty of high performance cars to choose from, including the McLaren F1, Ferrari F50, Lotus GT1, Jaguar XJ220, Ford GT90, Isdera Commendatore 112i, Italdesign Cala and Lotus Esprit V8, each handling differently.Once the player has beaten the six tracks, a new track is made available. It's a fast paced racing game which is intended to play more like an arcade racer than a true simulation, though the player can select which driving style suits him or her best: arcade or simulation. There are three game modes: single race, tournament (in which the player must get the highest score in order to win) and knock out (in which the player has to outrun at least one car at the end of each track to avoid elimination). Car settings such as gear ratio, downforce, break bias and color can be customized. The opponents' skill can also be chosen, as well as the presence of civilian traffic in the tracks. The game offers four options of camera views: heli-cam, tail-cam, in-car and road cam. A replay mode with eight cinematic cameras is also available.The main difference between this and the previous Need for Speed game is in the tracks, with less open road tracks in this sequel. Also, there are no cops to chase the player. However, the tracks available are have a range of detail, and some have changing weather conditions while the player races.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Buster Bros.

BBros and SBB both involve your world being attacked by the Bubble King (the funny synopsis of BBros in the instructions notes "One day for no particular reason the Bubble King began a siege on Earth's cities with multi-sized breakable bubbles"- Idi Amin he ain't.), while BBuddies involves precious art being guarded by bubbles- in a rare turn of events, you play as the thief looking to steal the art!</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Grand Slam</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-04-01</td><td>Virgin Interactive Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Burst</td><td>Sports</td><td></td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Grand Slam Baseball was an innovative, albeit relatively low-key release from Virgin Interactive Entertainment in 1997.Not known for sports games, VIE released Grand Slam for Windows, Sony Playstation and Sega Saturn as the second title in its attempt to establish a mainstream sports line. The first title in the short-lived line was Power Play Hockey in 1996. The sports line would last only one more title after Grand Slam's release, that being the sequel to the hockey game, also released in 1997.Grand Slam was one of the early adopters of 3D accelerator card technology and also offered full 3D play in software alone. The Playstation and Saturn versions were 3D by default.Grand Slam introduced a few play mechanics to video game baseball that would later prove to be fixtures in the genre. The most notable in this area was the introduction of a meter for pitching, used to control the velocity and accuracy of pitches, similar to the familiar swing meter in popular golf games. This meter was later borrowed and made popular by titles such as EA's MVP Baseball. On the batting side of things, a similar metered approach was used. This was inspired by older arcade baseball games that allowed the player to load up a swing's power with a control stick before releasing it as the pitch came in.Other highlights amongst Grand Slam's feature set included:- A trade AI engine that would examine the needs of a team and decide if a proposed trade was in its best interest.- Catcher AI and pitch signals, helping a player learn how to pitch to each batter's strengths and weaknesses.- Attention to details and baseball flavor, such as players that would blow bubble gum bubbles during an at bat, light- hearted commentary, an All Star Break during season play (complete with a working voting ballot), and an in-game JumboTron scoreboard that would show animations after home runs.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">BRAHMA Force: The Assault on Beltlogger 9</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-04-09</td><td>Jaleco USA, Inc.</td><td>Genki Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td>Mecha / giant robot</td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">A mech-based FPS; pilot your Bipedal Robotic Assault Heavy Mechanized Armor (built by Bronx Industries, of course) through the Beltlogger 9 excavation colony......discover what happened to the Beltlogger 9 colony- it may be related to the events on Probe Ship Mina 3, wherein a lone person apparently under the control of an outside intelligence slaughtered his shipmates.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Angelique Special 2</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-04-11</td><td>KOEI Co., Ltd.</td><td>KOEI Co., Ltd.</td><td>Adventure, Strategy</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Following the events of the  first Angelique game, Angelique Limoges has become the queen of Cosmos, and her former rival Rosalie - her aid.

The paths of these three heroes converge, and they team up to embark on a long journey, eager to understand their roles in a grand scheme of events that go back a thousand years into the past.Wild Arms is a Japanese-style role-playing game set in Filgaia, a fictional world that has elements of American Old West setting and medieval fantasy. The game's prologue consists of three chapters, each dedicated to one of its three main characters; afterwards, the player controls them as a party. Like most representatives of the genre, the game features turn-based battles against randomly appearing regular enemies and bosses. Besides attacking physically, the characters possess unique abilities - ARMs for Rudy, sword techniques for Jack, and magic for Cecilia. Characters can also equip special accessories (runes), which conjure powerful creatures known as the Guardians during battles, to attack enemies or assist the party by casting supportive spells.The game has a stronger inclination towards puzzle-solving than most other Japanese RPG. Each of the three playable characters possesses a set of non-combat abilities called "Tools"; for example, Rudy starts with an ability to blow up obstacles, Jack can send his talking mouse Hanpan to manipulate objects out of his reach, and Cecilia can rewind time to ensure another attempt at solving a puzzle. The game's dungeons contain puzzles, many of which must be solved by using these abilities. During the course of the game, the three heroes will gradually learn additional Tools.Various mini-games are also available. Characters and backgrounds in the game are done with 2D graphics during exploration; conversely, battles utilize a fully 3D environment with cinematic camera angles.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Descent Maximum</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-05-01</td><td>Interplay Productions, Inc.</td><td>Parallax Software Corp.</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td>Flight / aviation</td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Descent Maximum took the best parts of the original Descent and Descent II for the PC and adapted them to the Playstation game console.In Descent the player takes control of the "Material Defender" a pilot sent into a series of interstellar mines to rid them of the crazed robots that have taken over them.

While the Heretic was destroying D'Sparil, the other two Serpent Riders have come to your dimension and slaughtered everyone. Or so they thought. Three humans have managed to escape with their lives and now seek vengeance against the Serpent Rider Korax who remains in their world.Like Heretic, Hexen is a fantasy game based on an enhanced DOOM engine. All of Heretic's innovations like vertical looking, flying, and the inventory system have been carried over. The new major changes this time around are three characters for the player to choose from and the level hub system. The characters are the Fighter, the Cleric, and the Mage.  Each one has four unique weapons and different levels of speed and armor.The hub system steps away from the traditional "single levels stringed along into episodes" system which had been carried over into the FPS genre from sidescrollers and made popular by Wolfenstein 3D. In Hexen's hub system each episode is still made up of interconnected levels, but most of the levels are connected to a single "hub" level through portals. There are also portals between some of the "spoke" levels. Many of the puzzles in Hexen require travel back and forth between different levels.Other innovations in Hexen include weather effects, jumping, earth-quakes, and destructible objects such as trees and vases. The game also includes scripted sequences created with a language called ACS, allowing for much more complex puzzles and dramatic scenes. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Kōshien V</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-05-16</td><td>Magical Company Ltd.</td><td>Magical Company Ltd.</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">PlayStation Store Description (from Ad Blurbs)★This game is supported with the PSP® and PS Vita screenshot function★PSP®: Screenshots can be taken by using the menu after holding the PS button (HOME button) in the game.

The game puts heavy focus on battle mode and offers a detailed tutorial one can go through before starting the story mode. During the battle your character can use close-combat weapons such as sword, initiate special devastating attacks, or use magic and items either to combat or as a remedy.While traversing the world map you will encounter various cities which will let you visit stores to buy and sell items, or check the local inn to hear the gossips or save your game progress. While you start the game as a lone bounty hunter, you can have other characters join your party which in turn will participate in combat during the battle mode. The battle mode, however, does not let you control the characters directly. Instead, you can create trajectory paths which the characters will follow, and decide how they should act when encountering enemy combatants. Special attacks and magic spells can be initiated at any time, assuming you can perform them.The game offers a variety of character classes, each with their pros and cons. Some of the character classes include bounty hunters, knights, ninjas, samurais, amazons, clerics, priests, sorcerers, wizards, snipers, and more. Each of your party characters has its own level and can level up by gathering experience points in combat. In town shops you can buy swords, bows and arrows, and other weapons, as well as protective armor and special items to equip your part characters with and increase their winning chance in combat.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Quantum Gate</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-06-06</td><td>GAGA Communications Inc.</td><td>Hyperbole Studios</td><td>Action, Adventure</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td>Cyberpunk / dark sci-fi, Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Quantum Gate is an adventure game set on a distant planet,  in which you are sent out to fight in a war with an alien race.

This time the player experiences World War II from the Allied point of view during two British, one U.S. and one Russian campaign. The settings are Europe, Russia and Northern Africa.The most important thing to have are prestige points. These are earned by solving scenarios (more for less amount of turns used) and used to buy replacement units. But this is not the only reason to be concerned about the detailed mission results: surviving units are transferred to the next mission and receive experience points. The campaign is also not completely linear, and the next mission depends on the result of the last - this means a lost scenario does not necessarily result in a game over, and a scarce victory can have devastating results. Of course a great victory has positive effects on the next missions.Every turn the player plans the actions of his units and tries to defeat his enemy. The complexity of the game mostly comes from the many different units and weapons - everything has their use and weaknesses. It is vital to use the resources in the correct order and combination. There are also other factors to think about, e.g. fuel. Allied General tries to be player friendly by giving feedback during turns, e.g. by showing the probable combat result before the player issues the attack. He can also undo a turn as long as no new enemy units are scouted. Other extras are historical film material and optional combat animations.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Baby Universe</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-06-20</td><td>Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.</td><td>3D Kaleidoscope</td><td>Simulation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Music / rhythm</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Baby Universe in an experiment in visuals.

Before you start the game, you can choose from a various amount of robots, each being smaller or bigger, or having different attacks. As you progress the game, your opponents will get more difficult to beat. During a fight, your temperature bar will decrease when you manage not to get hit by your opponent.All the robots will start with 4 levels of armor. As you attack your opponent with missiles and bazookas, his temperature bar will increase. You can aim your long range weapons by holding them to the direction you wish to shoot at. The game will be over when one of the robot's armors are fully destroyed or when time limit reaches zero and one robot has more armor than its opponent. Special moves requires energy from the energy cap, which is shown right below the temperature bar.Your opponent will be beaten when he is overheated. When both robots are at the same level of armor, then the current temperature will decide the winner. You can block attacks in the air when you jump, but you cannot block when you are dashing.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Puzzle Arena Toshinden</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-06-20</td><td>TAKARA Co., Ltd.</td><td>Electronics Application Co., Ltd., TAKARA Co., Ltd.</td><td>Puzzle</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Falling block puzzle</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td>Real-time</td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Puzzle Arena Toshinden takes the furious fighters right out of the ring and into the world of puzzle games!

At the very beginning you will have to choose a main vocalist for the future band. There are five available, all with their own styles. Then you will have to cruise the city and visit eight different locations in order to meet other musicians and composers that will sell their songs.To successfully make a contract with a certain musician, you will have to answer few of their questions. If you don't choose the correct or appropriate option, you will not be able to make a contract and will have to wait until the musician appears again in the future. The band can be formed once a guitarist, bassist and drummer are hired. Then during the course of the gameplay, the band will have to make concerts in six different venues and release at least one CD under the three different recording companies. Promoting the gigs and CD releases are always essential to achieve success. During a concert, you can make few movements with the band members (except the drummer) and control the spotlights (and firework too but only in the last two venues).There are 10 songs available, and to play each one at its "fullest", you will need to gather the best lineup. If the band play a song with members that are not the most "adequate", the sound will be different (worse) than when you use the best lineup. Therefore the attendance number and money gain will be obviously poor.In the "band meeting", there are options such as "group talk" and "rehearsal". Choosing these two every single week will certainly influence the attendance of your upcoming gig and CD sales. Other options in band meeting include "song list" (where you can hear the songs you bought and read its lyrics), "member change", "band break up", "gigs" and "CD release".In the "band chart" you can check the gig attendances, CD sales, and listen to the song that your band played in a specific gig. Listening to them is important to spot which are the worst or best musicians for a certain song.All the members are replaceable except the vocalist, however you can still hire other four vocalists in order to buy other songs, but having a song doesn't guarantee that you can play it because each vocalist can only perform about four or them. A song can be bought only when a certain vocalist is under contract.The game will be over only when the money is all gone, that means if you choose "band break up", the game will still continue as long as there's still money left, and you can start a new adventure with a new band. Meanwhile if a contracted musician is not used for a long period of time, he or she will eventually resign. Also, if the gameplay takes too long, the band will automatically disband by itself due to lack of motivation.To finish the game, the band must release a cd under "Bonny Record", and reach an attendance of at least 65000 people in the Tokyo City Dome. To access this final gig, you will have to play a song with the best lineup for it, otherwise you will not be allowed to access this last venue. Once you reach or surpass that number, the ending movie will start playing.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">War Gods</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-06-20</td><td>Midway Home Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Midway Manufacturing Company</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Fighting</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">War Gods is a one-on-one fighting game that takes place in 3D environments.

ELECTRONIC ARTS SHIPS NCAA FOOTBALL 98 FOR THE PLAYSTATION



EA SPORTS' Top Selling College Football Video Game Graduates From 16-Bit to Advanced Gaming Platform


SAN MATEO, Calif.,  August 5, 1997 -- Electronic Arts® (Nasdaq:ERTS), a leading global interactive entertainment software company, today announced the shipment of NCAA® Football 98 for the PlayStation’.  NCAA Football 98 is the latest version of EA SPORTS'’ best-selling college football video game line.  Previously only available on the Sega’ Genesis’ 16-bit game console, fans of this franchise have been waiting for its arrival on the PlayStation.

NCAA Football 98 includes all 112 teams from the ten different Division I-A conferences.  It has 20 all-time historic games, with 40 of the greatest college football teams ever to step onto the gridiron.  It is therefore possible to recreate such memorable games as the historic 1987 Fiesta Bowl that featured the great 1986 teams from Penn State and Miami.  Accurate position rankings and skill levels for each school enhance the game's realism.

Exclusive rights to the Fed Ex Orange Bowl, Tostitos Fiesta Bowl and Nokia Sugar Bowl provide real life bowl games not found in any other interactive football game.  NCAA Football 98 also has the rights to the Rose Bowl.  The 1998 Fed Ex Orange Bowl will host this season's National Championship game, and with the exclusive rights to this bowl NCAA Football 98 is the only interactive college football game in which the user can play for the undisputed National Championship.

"We have created a football game that stays true to the feel of a Saturday afternoon college event," said Rob Martyn, executive producer, EA SPORTS.  "You'll hear the voice of Rose Bowl announcer Chuck White during the game.  We worked with former UCLA coach Terry Donahue to make sure the playbook for each team was authentic and reflects the style of play that team actually uses.  You play this game and you feel like you are on the field and part of the college football experience.  The emotion, tradition, rivalries and enthusiasm that surround the college game is very intense and EA SPORTS has captured that feeling in NCAA Football 98."
The level of detail in the game is incredible from the jersey numbers that are shown on each player, to 122 fully-rendered and authentically reproduced stadiums for every team in the league, plus extra stadiums used in post-season play.  Even the most minute details were taken care of, such as the field starting to degrade in quality over the course of the game if it's raining.  Also, over 30 licensed fight songs are in the game.  In order to ensure a competitive game against the computer, whether the game player is a novice or an expert, skill setting can be placed at Junior Varsity, Varsity or All-American levels.  Saved instant replays allow the user to save a great play to a PlayStation memory card and carry it to a friend's house to replay.

NCAA Football 98 has features unique to the college game that distinguish it from other football games on the market.  Dynasty mode allows the user to build a powerhouse program over the course of multiple seasons.  In dynasty mode, after the season the user can pick blue-chip recruits from a field of incoming freshman.  The better the previous season's record, the better the caliber of athletes available to your team.  Thus, a weak team can be built up to national champion by quality play and shrewd recruiting.  As seniors graduate, it is up to the player to replace them with talented freshman who can help build the program.

Rival mode instantly brings up the main rival for each team in the game, and with every Division I-A school in the game the number of matchups is huge.  With team rivalries being a major part of college football, the rival mode adds an element to the game that defines what the college football experience is all about.  Many times a winning season for a team is still considered a failure because of the simple fact that the team lost to its main rival.  NCAA Football 98 captures that feeling and immerses the user in the passion of the college game.

It is based closely on the previous year's edition, but with the usual updates, revisions and several new features. Compared to versions on other platforms, the 32-bit console version comes with its own graphics engine and selection of teams, modes and options.The game includes the 30 teams of the 1997 NFL season, the 1997 All-Madden team and 85 classic teams from NFL history, spanning 1960 to 1996. All the team's home stadiums plus the Pro Bowl stadium in Hawaii and the Super Bowl stadium in San Diego are available. Further teams and stadiums can be unlocked via secret codes. Returning playing modes from the predecessor are Exhibition, Season (including Playoffs and Super Bowl, based on the 1997 NFL schedule) and Tournament (8 or 16 player single elimination). Added to these are the new Custom Season and Fantasy Draft. Custom Season allows players to customize the NFL divisions and thus the schedule with all available teams, including the classic teams. Fantasy Draft is a custom tournament mode for four or eight teams. Players create their own teams by giving them names and then drafting players. The tournament consists of a round-robin round followed by semi-finals and finals. The option of creating and trading players also returns, and can be made more realistic by employing salary caps and trading deadlines within a season.During a game, the same graphics style employed by the previous year's game is used: polygonally-rendered 3D stadiums with players, ball and referees as 2D bitmaps. The camera can be toggled between several perspectives, with most returning from the predecessor, but some being replaced by new ones.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">NFL GameDay 98</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-08-26</td><td>Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc.</td><td>Sony Interactive Studios America</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">NFL GameDay '98 has new and previous features like Preseason, Season, and Training Camp modes.

However, after a while, it becomes apparent that there are other forces at work, and ultimately Cloud must not only fight against Shinra but also stop a powerful man from his past from destroying the world.Like its predecessors, Final Fantasy VII is a role-playing game in Japanese style, featuring turn-based combat with a real-time (ATB, "active time battle") element against randomly appearing enemies. Customization in the game revolves around a so-called "Materia" system. Instead of magic spells, abilities, and bonus stats being saved to a single character, they are saved to Materia orbs, allowing the player to change a character's spells and abilities from the equipment menu at any time. Materia orbs can be bought in stores or found during exploration. The series' trademark summoned monsters are also contained within specific Materia. Besides experience points, characters also receive ability points that gradually upgrade the abilities of the currently equipped Materia.Each character also possesses a set of unique attacks called "Limit Breaks". By sustaining enough damage without dying a character will build up their Limit Gauge, which can be expended to do a highly damaging attack when filled. More powerful Limit Breaks are unlocked as previous ones are used, and acquiring the most powerful Limit Break of each character will require the completion of sub-quests. The game utilizes 3D character models and pre-rendered backgrounds with varying camera angles for the exploration of towns and hostile areas. World map navigation and battle screens are done completely in 3D. CG movies are frequently used as cutscenes that advance the game's story. The game features a large number of mini-games (most of which are optional) and many ways to explore the game world, as the player gradually acquires various vehicles that can venture into previously inaccessible locations.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Formula 1: Championship Edition</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-09-01</td><td>Psygnosis Limited</td><td>Bizarre Creations, Ltd.</td><td>Racing / Driving, Sports</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Automobile, Track racing, Vehicle simulator</td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">An updated version of Psygnosis' first Formula 1 game.

The food factories have found a new type of meat, delicious to all the inhabitants, though no one knows the recipe. Following his stomach, Abe eavesdrops on the corporate leaders' conversation and makes the most frightening and disgusting discovery: his own race is that secret delicious food. Alas, Abe has been spotted, and the guards are marching towards him. He must escape, but he can't leave his friends to the mercy of the Glukkons and their henchmen. He must rescue as many as he can, and tell the world the truth about what he has found out.Abe's Oddysee is the first game set in the fictional Oddworld universe. It is a platformer with puzzle-solving elements, focusing on the portrayal of a weak, underpowered character in a grim and hostile world, who has to rely on his cunning to outwit enemies and overcome hazards. Abe is almost completely helpless: he cannot use weapons and is usually instantly killed by his brutal enemies if he confronts them directly. For this reason, most of the game involves careful exploration, timed movement, sneaking, and outsmarting the foes through various means: throwing stones to confuse them, luring them into traps, etc. Abe can run, jump, climb, tiptoe, crouch, and roll; in most areas, these actions are essential to his survival. A few stages involve Abe riding a large animal known as Elum.Abe's only special power is chanting, which he can use to stun certain enemies for a while or possess them. When Abe possesses an enemy he gains his abilities: for example, possessing the body or a ferocious Slig allows the player to shoot from his machine gun, communicate with other creatures of his kind, and even commit suicide, clearing the way for Abe. Chanting is also used to open "bird portals", which is the final action needed to bring a fellow Mudokon to safety. Before that, Abe needs to locate his enslaved friends and lead them out of the hostile environment by using a communication method called "Gamespeak". Gamespeak is a way of verbal communication through simple commands, which are assigned to various expressions, such as "Hello", "Follow me", "Wait here", etc. It can also be used to memorize passwords given to Abe by other Mudokons in a few areas. Many areas in which Abe can save Mudokons are hidden and not required to complete the game.  However, the ending of the game differs depending on the number of Mudokons saved by the player. The game has pre-rendered background graphics and uses CG movies of similar style to advance the story between the levels.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">RayStorm</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-09-01</td><td>SPAZ, Working Designs</td><td>Taito Corporation</td><td>Action</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">RayStorm is a shoot'em-up game created for the arcades, later ported to the Playstation and Saturn home consoles.

You can play alone, or with a number of computer-controlled rivals. At the beginning of the game, you (and your rivals) have a large terrain at your disposal. The terrain is shown in isometric projection and includes hills, rivers, lakes, bridges, industrial facilities and a lot of small towns. It is up to you to decide how to start building your empire. Maybe you can begin by connecting two towns with a road, building a vehicle depot somewhere next to the road, and setting up bus stops in both towns. Now just buy a bus (initially, there are just a few models available, but more buses appear with time), set its schedule, and watch as it goes between both bus stops, taking passengers and unloading them, earning you money. You can also transport passengers by building train tracks, sea ports, or airports and then buying appropriate vehicles - trains, ferries, planes. If you set up a station next to an industrial facility (such as a factory, a power plant or a farm), you can also transport various cargo, such as coal, livestock or wood, which allows you to earn much more money than transporting passengers. Of course, you'll have to buy special lorries and train cars if you'll want to deal with these. Most businesses offer certain types of cargo and are ready to pay for transporting other cargo to them; for example, a steel mill has a lot of steel to fill your cars, and will gladly accept iron ore if you have any. Clicking on any of your vehicles brings up a small window where you can observe a live feed of what the vehicle is doing and look up its status. If anything important happens during the game (such as a particular station accepting its first vehicle), it is shown as a newspaper headline at the bottom of the screen. Various versions exist building upon the DOS original, with the most notably different being the PlayStation port, which in addition to the isometric graphics includes a 3D view of the world map taking advantage of the PlayStation’s graphics hardware. The game was followed up with the release of the World Editor and later re-released in enhanced form as Transport Tycoon Deluxe.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Nobunaga no Yabō: Tenshōki with Power Up Kit</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-09-11</td><td>KOEI Co., Ltd.</td><td>KOEI Co., Ltd.</td><td>Compilation, Strategy</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td>War</td><td>Wargame</td><td>Historical events, Japan (Ancient/Classical/Medieval)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">A compilation of Nobunaga no Yabō: Tenshōki and Nobunaga no Yabō: Tenshōki - Power Up Kit.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Romance of the Three Kingdoms IV with Power Up Kit</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-09-11</td><td>KOEI Co., Ltd.</td><td>KOEI Co., Ltd.</td><td>Compilation, Strategy</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>China (Ancient / Imperial), Historical events</td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td>Isometric</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Romance of the Three Kingdoms IV with Power Up Kit is the compilation of Romance of the Three Kingdoms IV: Wall of Fire and Sangokushi IV: Power Up Kit.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">CART World Series</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-09-16</td><td>Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc.</td><td>Sony Interactive Studios America</td><td>Racing / Driving</td><td></td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Automobile, Track racing, Vehicle simulator</td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">CART World Series, endorsed by Championship Auto Racing Teams, is Sony's first attempt at the world of CART racing. With the official endorsing and license, the developers were able to include a lot of realistic elements from the racetrack into the game.All of the top-rated CART drivers (circa 1996-1997) have been included and programmed to match their real-life abilities (based on a statistics standpoint). Al Unser Jr., Bobby Rahal, Gil de Ferran and many more are there to use or to race against. Each one has their own unique car, which can be tuned-up and modified any way you'd likeModification comes in the way of tweaking a car's performance. If you know a lot about cars and how they handle, you can adjust their tires to fit the road (hard or soft) as well as modify their gear systems and aerodynamics. By moving the front of the car down or slanting the wings, you may be able to find a perfect combination for speed and performance. During races, a car's tire will wear down and it will eventually run out of fuel. Pit stops are necessary for a successful victory.In addition to the real drivers and cars (Honda and Ford included), ten official CART tracks have been included – each modeled after their real-life counterpart. Tracks span the United States and are located in Cleveland, Michigan, Long Beach and more. Each features realistic dynamics and road handling in an attempt to create a believable racing experience.As far as gameplay goes, you've got the following options: Arcade, Simulation, Practice, Single Race, 10 Race Season. The season play is simply a series of races in which you must qualify and race for the cup and the arcade and simulation modes both keep track of individual racer statistics. If you're still getting used to an Analog Controller, you may want to make a few practice runs before starting a season.Additionally, CART World Series supports two players via split-screen or a Link Cable.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Agent Armstrong</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-09-18</td><td>Virgin Interactive Entertainment (Europe) Ltd.</td><td>King of the Jungle Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Agent Armstrong is a 3D side-scrolling single-player-shooter released in the early days of the PSX.

The weekly schedule is set by selecting locations on the map you wish to visit, one location per day. Different location offer different actions and participation in various events and meeting and talking to other characters. Each heroine has a default set of attributes which change over time, such as physical strength, self-confidence, stress, speaking skill, and other. During gameplay, static character images with mild animations such as talking, are glued over blurred real-life photos which are used as backgrounds.Heroines with selectable voice-actresses include:

Unlike Resident Evil for the GameCube, it is not a remake of the original game, instead, it is more of a slight remix.There are three gameplay modes available.  "Original" contains the original game with no changes or additions.  "Beginner" features double the amount of ammunition and save ribbons, plus increased health for the player, increased damage for their weapons, and an auto-target feature."Arrange" mode is the "Director's Cut" version of the original.  The default outfits for Jill, Chris, and Rebecca are changed, new camera angles are introduced, and the placement of key items is changed.  Most of these changes are designed to play against the expectations of veteran players of the first Resident Evil - so zombie dogs may smash through new windows, or keys will not be where they were, forcing players to hunt for them anew.  The default Beretta pistol is also changed to a chromed version with a randomized chance to kill standard zombies in one shot.The original release of the Director's Cut advertised an uncut version of the opening cinema, in full color, and never-before seen.  Notable aspects of this video include shots of a corpse with bites taken out of the face, close-ups of zombie dogs bleeding when shot, and graphic quick-cuts of Joseph being bitten by these dogs. Chris is also shown smoking in his introduction, which was cut from Western releases.  However, only the French and German releases contained this footage.  U.S. and UK versions retained the censored black-and-white video shipped with the original release.  This has never been corrected, either in the Greatest Hits reissue, or with the PSOne Classics downloads on the Playstation Network.The original issue of the Director's Cut contained a demo of Resident Evil 2 on a second disc.

Players can view the plane they're flying while racing or they can choose to view the race from inside their cockpit. Players can turn a guide option on or off, with the guide being on, it helps the player stay on course and not fly out of bound by placing a trail to follow. Players also have to get to each course's checkpoints before a timer counts down to zero. If the player makes it to a checkpoint on time, their time is extended so they can get to the next one. During a race, players may see an S icon that when touched will give the player's plane a temporary burst of speed. Planes also can perform aerobatic rolls to quickly get out of danger. If a plane crashes, the players starts where they crashed, but costs them precious amounts of time. If players don't make it to the checkpoint on time, the race is over.The game also features a 2 player mode where 2 players race against each other while in split-screen.

You must now become a reluctant hero, as you pursue Quan Chi trough hell itself hoping you get to Shinnok before him.Gameplay wise the game takes the Mortal Kombat familiar 2D fighting environment and turns it into a hybrid fighter/platformer game, where you must travel trough hazardous levels running and jumping around as well as fighting your way against both digitized and polygonal enemies. Sub-Zero's interface is the same as in every MK game, with the addition of a "use" and "turn around" buttons and additions such as an inventory, and a slight RPG twist in which you get exp. for defeating opponents, which translates into new techniques and moves to execute in the game.Technically speaking this game represents the final evolutionary step in the MK's series 2D engines.

Now, Richter has suddenly vanished, Dracula's castle has mysteriously reappeared, and Maria, now a young woman, sets off to find Richter. Alucard, the son of Dracula, is awakened from his eternal slumber after this large shift in power and enters into the castle to find some answers and confront his father.Symphony of the Night is a direct sequel to Rondo of Blood. Unlike the previous installments of the series, the game is set in a castle which the player can explore freely with many different paths, although often items in certain areas need to be found that will allow passage to others. The action-based gameplay incorporates now strong RPG elements. The hero receives experience points for defeating enemies, gains levels, and becomes more powerful. There is also money to be found in the game, and various accessories to buy. In a separate screen, players need to equip attack weapons, shields, and other items. Magic plays an important role, as well as secondary weapons and a large amount of "special moves" that are executed similar to advanced one-on-one fighting games.The Saturn release adds two new areas to the castle (the Underground Garden and the Haunted Path), a third playable character (Maria), and a few new remixed music tracks. However, it sacrifices a few of the graphical effects from the PlayStation version, particularly true transparencies. The  iOS and Android versions are based on the version found in the Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles release (has the Saturn versions familiars and items).

The hero is teleported into an alternate world, a kingdom that is a mixture of medieval and modern day-like environment. This world is in danger, and only those who have the magical "voice power" can save it! The hero meets the young female magician named Whip and the princess of the country, Fret; together, they must stop the evil and figure out a way for the hero to go back to his world.Voice Fantasia might look like an RPG, but in reality its gameplay is much closer to the adventure variety, the RPG elements reducing to a mini game-like status. Most of the gameplay here is dedicated to exploring the world, talking to characters, and acquiring and using items needed to advance the story. The infrequent turn-based battles are dictated by the story. Three girls join the party, and are able to use "voice powers", which are in effect attacks of various properties. There is no experience system of any kind.There is also a mild "dating simulation" element in the game. The player is able to buy presents for the girls, invite them for dinner, etc. When staying at the hotel, those anime-style fantasy characters are replaced by video footage of real voice actresses. The player is able to talk to them and ask a variety of questions.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">WCW vs. the World</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-10-07</td><td>THQ Inc.</td><td>Man Breeze, Inc., The</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Wrestle the world's toughest WCW wrestlers.

A sword imbued with magical powers was made in order to destroy the dragon. It was known as the Blade of Darkness. The dragon was defeated, and the sword disappeared after the battle. Now, unholy people attempt the resurrection of the Black Dragon. Shinobu Ryudo, a young girl from the Dark-Haired tribe, begins a long and perilous journey across the main continent to find the sword and prevent the dragon's resurrection. Meanwhile, the warrior Kayes is instructed by the oracle to look for the sword as well. Will the heroes join forces to defeat the evil?..Kuro no Ken is a rather standard Japanese-style RPG with all the familiar ingredients: top-down locations, navigation on the world map, random enemies, turn-based combat, automatic leveling up, etc. The battles are viewed from a third-person perspective, using much larger character sprites than during exploration. Shinobu and Kayes can use physical attacks or magic spells (learned automatically when leveling up), which deplete MP. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Moonlight Syndrome</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-10-09</td><td>Human Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Human Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Adventure</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td>Horror</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Masayuki Fujita (藤田 政行), Yoichiro Shimazaki (島崎 洋一郎)</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">A teenage girl named Mika meets a mysterious person on her way home, who warns her of horrifying events that are about to happen to her and her friends.

Now Mika must find out what is truly happening around her. And so does Ryo, Kyoko's brother, who has been seeing strange dreams lately...A sequel to the original two  Twilight Syndrome games, Moonlight Syndrome has a similarly text-heavy, low-interaction, linear gameplay with dialogue and/or action choices, which would sometimes influence the course of the narrative. Like Twilight Syndrome games (and unlike most Japanese-style adventure games), Moonlight Syndrome has physical character navigation in limited 3D areas. Some scenes - such as most full-screen dialogue portraits, etc. - are depicted as pre-rendered images. The player controls different characters, starting with Mika, then switching to Ryo; most of the gameplay consists of walking/running to the next screen, triggering the next dialogue/scene.

The last vestige of central authority is in the form of the G-Police (Government Police); an independent agency tasked with keeping order in the colonies. You play as rookie Jeff Slater - a former military pilot going undercover at the G-Police squadron on Callisto, in the hopes of finding the truth behind your sister's sudden death.G-Police is an arcade-style helicopter shooter set inside the colony domes on Callisto. You pilot a futuristic close-air-support gunship, and are tasked with engaging ground and air enemies as you uncover a sinister corporate plot. Your ship can hover and turn in a VTOL mode, fire weapons outfitted before each mission, and lock on to objects in the world to both track enemies and scan suspicious cargo.

It looks somewhat similar in concept to New York Race based on The Fifth Element movie. The car is always on the move, and while you can speed up or slow down - you can't stop it and also you can't go back, only maneuver across the screen - just like in a typical shmup title. Your vehicle is armed with some basic projectile type guns and you could pick up other types of weapons floating around the levels.The game story is based on the same name comic book by Frank Miller and Geof Darrow that was published in the early 90s. Here you play as Nixon who thinks he's a regular tax collector in dystopian retro-futuristic Los Angeles, but actually a cyborg-assassin for one of the big corporations that gets his memory reformatted once in a while. The gameplay is centered around riding your hovercar and shooting your way through the various city locales destroying all sorts of vehicles, turrets, barriers and occasional boss in the process. There are five missions in total with their own sets of enemy units and level design.

Day and night he sits in front of his GameStation and plays a game called Moon: a typical Japanese RPG with a sword-wielding hero who kills monster after monster on his grand epic quest. Skipping through the boring, cliche story, the boy continues to play until his mother tells him to stop and go to bed. However, the TV on which he was just playing the game miraculously turns itself on, and the boy is sucked into the world of Moon, a fantasy land called Love-de-Gard. It turns out that the hero of the game that the boy was playing is a troublesome individual, who does nothing else but slaughter various creatures populating the land, barge into people's houses bothering them with questions and taking their possessions without asking, and complain that he "can't reach the final dungeon". Souls of the animals the hero has killed find no rest, and the land's inhabitants are horrified. The boy realizes that there can only be one answer to that: love.Moon: Remix RPG Adventure is an adventure game with light role-playing elements that parodies the RPG genre by presenting a situation in which the player character must act in a way opposite to the usual behavior of typical RPG protagonists. There is no combat in the game. Core gameplay resembles that of adventure games: the player explores various locations, talks to characters and solves problems in a non-violent way. The game's world is open-ended, and story progression is non-linear. The world has a day and night cycle as well as an internal calendar, with people following their own schedules daily. The main goal consists of raising the protagonist's "love level", which is achieved by fulfilling people's wishes. In many cases it is not immediately obvious what people really wish for, and the player has to gather clues and learn more about the game world's inhabitants in order to find a way to make a particular character happy. Some of these activities are timed. Soul-catching, i.e. resurrecting the animals killed by the hero of the game Moon, is one of the ways to increase the love level. Amassing love points raises the "action limit", which is the amount of time the boy can stay in Love-de-Gard. If the action limit falls to zero, the game is over.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Wizard's Harmony 2</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-10-16</td><td>Arc System Works Co., Ltd.</td><td>Arc System Works Co., Ltd.</td><td>Simulation, Strategy</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy, Medieval</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">PlayStation Store Description (from Ad Blurbs)To download content to the Memory Stick PRO Duo™ of your PSP® (PlayStation®Portable) system, the free space required is twice the size of the content to be downloaded.This software is playable for PLAYSTATION®3 and PSP® (PlayStation®Portable).To download this software, you must also have at least 180MB of free space on your PLAYSTATION®3 system's hard disk.To play this software with your PSP®, the latest system software and a Memory Stick Duo™ with at least 180MB of free space are required.For more detail information about download to your PSP® system, please see below URL.http://asia.playstation.comWhen downloading using PC:When downloading contents to PSP®, you must install the PLAYSTATION®Network Downloader application first.

Sometime in the 20th century, a group of Narukagami ninja, each proficient in a different style, find themselves in a battle to regain their honor in the fighting ring.Bushido Blade is a versus fighting game with several unique features. It does away with health bars, special meters, and other traditional gimmicks and allows for battles to be won with a single hit. Players select from among six ninja, each of a different fighting style and attributes. Players also choose equipment from among eight weapons, including Japanese swords, European blades, naginata and a sledgehammer. Battles take place in wide open areas in which combatants can run around as well as climb up and down. Some structures, like bamboo trees, can even be cut down. In the single player game, players can even run through the entire castle, picking a preferred fighting ground location. In addition to the single player story mode, there's a versus mode, a slash mode where you will be attacked by 100 generic ninja in one long corridor, a training, and a 'POV' mode, which allows players to play from first person, heightening the realism. The game's versus mode can also be played using two Playstations linked up.Gameplay involves picking one of three stances, then attacking high, middle, or low. Directions while attacking change attacks, and attacks can be combo'd. Player damage is location based, with hits to arms often making them useless, hits to legs crippling, and hits to heads and clean across the torso being mortal. The use of stances and the easily achieved one hit kills make Bushido Blade one of the most deadly, and therefore realistic, weapon fighters around. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Rampage World Tour</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-10-21</td><td>Midway Home Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Game Refuge Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Rampage World Tour is an updated version of the classic Rampage.  Rampage World Tour starts off at Scumlabs International where three lab technicians, George, Lizzy, and Ralph have mutated in an accident involving toxic waste.  George has turned into a gigantic ape, Lizzy a gigantic lizard or dinosaur, and Ralph some sort of gigantic wolf.  The three destroy the lab they previously worked at and then embark on a path of destruction encompassing the entire globe.The player chooses one of these three characters and begins destroying buildings, eating civilians, knocking planes out of the sky, and stepping on tanks.  The ultimate goal of the game is to rid the world of Scumlabs by traveling to the cities where they are located.  Being creatures of such massive size, there are many cities that must be destroyed along the way.  Scumlabs and the various militaries make it a priority to destroy you and optionally another player that can play simultaneously.The graphics are worth noting as they are of a unique, colorful "cartoon" flavor.  Gameplay includes players climbing buildings while punching, kicking, and eating their inhabitants to destroy them.  Once all the buildings for a particular stage have been destroyed, the stage is clear and players proceed to the next stage.  Players can get many different kinds of power-ups that make them more powerful or restore health.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Pandemonium 2</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-10-23</td><td>Midway Home Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Crystal Dynamics, Inc., Toys for Bob Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Platform, Puzzle elements</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In this sequel to  Pandemonium, the player once again controls the young aspiring sorceress Nikki and the court jester Fargus with his puppet buddy Sid.

The evil Goon Queen Zorrscha wants to use the comet for her own plans, so our heroes have to reach it first...The gameplay is similar to that of the first game; despite the 3D graphics, the gameplay mechanics are those of 2D platformers. The player can select Nikki or Fargus for each level. Each of the two has different abilities. For example, Nikki can jump higher, while Fargus can use his puppet Sid for a variety of attacks. The characters can also acquire power-ups, such as fire and lightning ranged attacks for Nikki or various Sid enhancements for Fargus.

But what he lacks is confidence - help PaRappa rap his way through learning Kung Fu, a driving test, cooking and more, all in order to get the girl.  And remember - You Gotta Believe!PaRappa the Rapper is a game based on lyrics, music and rhythm.  The game itself is very basic - each stage has a 'teacher', that PaRappa must follow.  You'll see the teacher say some lyrics, and then PaRappa must copy the teacher by pressing the appropriate buttons to repeat those lyrics back.  Rap well, and you'll be able to continue; fudge up the lyrics, and the music will start to distort and the teacher will become displeased.  Continue to mess up and you'll fail the stage.Of course, the goal is not to copy the teacher, but instead to outperform them - you can do this by improvising in the song's gaps.  Listen to how the song goes, and improvise in time to the music; if you perform well enough, the teacher will step aside, leaving you to freestyle on your own!The PSP version of the game is a remake of the PlayStation original.  However, it includes a few upgrades, such as a 16:9 display, sharper graphics, game sharing, multiplayer support of up to four players, and the addition of song remixes, which can be downloaded via the internet onto your Memory Stick Duo.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Kindaichi Shōnen no Jikenbo: Hihōtō - Arata Naru Sangeki</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-11-20</td><td>Kodansha Ltd.</td><td>Digital Frontier</td><td>Adventure</td><td>1st-person</td><td>Licensed</td><td>Detective / mystery</td><td>Visual novel</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Hihōtō: Arata Naru Sangeki (悲報島 新たなる惨劇) is the first game in Kindaichi Case Files series to come on PlayStation platform. While the setting is the same as in TV anime, the game features an original story. The story protagonist is Hajime Kindaichi (金田一 一), a 16-year old sophomore who inherited a knack for solving mysteries from his grandfather, a legendary detective.As the title implies, the game takes place on Hihoutou, an island that is rumored to hold a vast treasure. An island owner, Shi Mimasaka (美作 氏) was planning a treasure hunting tour, and Kindaichi found himself on the list of invited people. Along with his girlfriend, Miyuki, he went on the island only to find out that Mr. Mimasaka has been brutally murdered. There also has been a rumor that a monster is guarding the treasure on Hihoutou island, and as all the guests seem to have been unable to kill the island owner, the question of whether the island monster really exists became of utmost importance.This murder mystery mainly plays as a visual novel, and focuses strongly on dialogues with other characters, but also allows the player to search each room and location, check info about suspects which he keeps track of in his notebook, and traverse the map, both in the mansion and all over the island. The game also features fully animated as well as pre-rendered cut-scenes. While the dialogue is no entirely present during conversations, animated cut-scenes feel just as the TV animated series.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Konami Antiques: MSX Collection Vol. 1</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-11-20</td><td>Konami Co., Ltd.</td><td>Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo, Inc., Konami Industry Co.

The next thing they know, they are suddenly on a coaster, abducted to Mad Land by the creepy Dr. Jones. He tells them about his son Masao, who loved roller coasters. For his son, he dedicated his life to build the best roller coaster in the world. One day however, a spark ignited the coaster under construction, burning it down and disfiguring the doctor. Still, he did not give up, and after many years, the coaster was completed. But Masao had already grown up, and did not care about coasters anymore.Mad Panic Coaster is a fast-paced roller coaster action game with a mix of punk/skating and horror/monster themes. While rushing along the roller coaster track at ludicrous speeds, try to avoid enemies, obstacles and falling off. There are five environments with three stages each, and a boss fight after every third stage. Survive three laps around the track to finish a stage. There is a health bar which depletes when you fall off the track or take hits; falling off with an empty health bar leads to a game over.The game features a sizable soundtrack of punk rock and metal tracks.

The player must build a team out of several available pilots, assigning a mecha or another type of craft (plane, mobile rocket-launcher, etc.) depending on the type of mission and its requirements. The player then proceeds to the actual mission, navigating squad members in turn-based fashion through a top-down area. Like in the first game, tactical considerations (pre-mission choices, positioning of team members, etc.) sometimes carry more weight than actual armed confrontations with the enemy.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">The Master's Fighter</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-11-20</td><td>Cinema Supply</td><td>Unico Electronics Co., Ltd. </td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Fighting</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The Master's Fighter is a remake of the arcade 2D fighting game Master's Fury.

One day, they get a request from the Galactic Police to respond to a pirate attack on Jack Station, and they jump at the chance.Crime Crackers 2 is the sequel to Crime Crackers, and is again a first-person action game in a similar style. It takes place two years after the original, following a team of Crackers who got into the business after being inspired by Team Pink Dolphin, the heroes of the first game. Just like the previous title, the player must explore each area, defeating enemies and collecting items until they find and defeat the boss.There are several changes to the system since the first title. The most significant is the elimination of action mode: The player can now always attack forward, giving the game a faster pace than its predecessor, but still more deliberate than, say, Doom. The team size has increased to four, and again each member has their own specific abilities, as well as their own life and weapon energy meters.The game is otherwise quite similar to the first game. The story is driven through communication from the support team during missions, as well as in animated cutscenes between them. There is also the option to buy and sell items between missions. The game also features a branching storyline with numerous endings, and will even keep track of which branches the player has played through.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Dragon Beat: Legend of Pinball</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-11-27</td><td>Map Japan Co., Ltd.</td><td>Map Japan Co., Ltd.</td><td>Simulation</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td>Pinball</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Dragon Beat serves up three realistic, pseudo 3D, single-screen pinball tables.

It takes place in occupied France just prior to the invasion of Normandy and the task in each of the game's six levels is to destroy a certain target, usually some sort of tank or other heavily armoured object.Like in other rail shooters the movement through the levels are automatic and all the player has to do is move a crosshair and shoot down the various German soldiers and vehicles that attack him. Two weapons are available at any time: a rapidly firing machine gun and a far slower rocket launcher. Ammo is available in unlimited quantities but has to be reloaded which happens automatically when the player releases the trigger. The game is time based and lacks both hit points and lives. Instead taking damage leads to time being removed and when it reaches zero the game is over (although there is a continue option to restart the current level).

As the blob-like "puyos" start falling in your play area, you must align them and create groups of the same color in order to clear the screen before you get flooded with puyos. Chaining puyos of different colors allows you to send several "garbage" puyos to the opposing player's play area in hopes of either flooding it, or slowing his advance, and whoever defeats the opposing player moves on to the next challenger.New for Puyo Puyo Sun are the Sun Puyos, which can be added to combos for extra damage.

The player assumes the role of Hajime, who after going to visit his best friend, finds himself trapped in a hospital along with two friends, Ryou and Tomowo, and a rookie nurse, Aya. The gameplay consists of exploring locations in the hospital by moving in a certain direction (forward, turn left or right, or turn back) which uses pre-rendered animation for every movement from one point to another. Certain locations can be zoomed in to give you more details or to pick up an item. Your companions will often give you some comments while you explore, most of which may seem a selection of five sentences that are randomly selected.

The game world is presented as a series of computer-generated still screens; the player explores it in a point-and-click fashion. Interaction with the environment is possible only when said environment is highlighted as a "hot spot", and is also performed by simple clicking.

Touch the "flag" in the sector and it's yours. Capture the sector before the new unit comes out of the manufactory and the new unit is yours. With six different robots (different armaments, armor, and speed), multiple vehicles (from jeeps to tanks) the robots can utilize, your ultimate objective is to destroy the opponent's base, and prevent him from doing the same to you.The game differs from many other RTSs by emphasizing territorial control (and the manufactories) instead of getting kills and gathering a big army. You have to finely balance defense and offense. If you wait too long, the enemy will grab all the manufactories first. If you go too fast, you'll get hammered for stretching yourself too thin. You can hijack enemy vehicles by shooting the driver off. If you send a group of soldiers toward an objective and they find a vehicle, one of them will split off to grab the vehicle; you don't really need to micromanage each soldier.

The story is set in the future and focuses on a team of policemen led by the female cyborg Major Motoko Kusanagi, which fights technology-related crimes. The player takes the role of a new member in Kusanagi's anti-terrorist squad and gets to accomplish missions on the Fuchikoma, a spider-like AI equipped tank. During the course of the twelve missions a plot starts to surface concerning a giant skyscraper, the Aereopolis II.The Fuchikoma can be controlled from either third- or first-person view. It is permanently equipped with a machine gun, homing missiles (which are activated by holding the attack button), and limited supplies of grenades; there are no other weapons or tools in the game.

This badge, sent out by the mysterious Merkuar, is in fact an invitation to a dangerous tournament held in England, where the contestants fight for money, power, and glory. Now, a poor young fighter from Hong Kong named Rickey Leon has just received one of these badges.Critical Blow is a 1-on-1 fighting game, and the sequel to Shadow Struggle. Though the game features a full-3D view, gameplay takes place in a traditional 2D plane. In addition to a standard life meter, each character has a Special Guage, which increases as the battle proceeds and allows the characters to use special moves of varying power, called Assault Blows, Super Blows, and the titular Critical Blows. Several game modes also allow the player to earn, apply, and wager a number of types of Cards, which provide different benefits to the character such as extra moves, stronger attacks, or elemental affinities.The game boasts four different game modes: Tournament, Trading, Theater, and Versus. Tournament is a standard arcade mode where the player can select any available character and fight the others in sequence. Trading mode allows the player to fight computer opponents to earn additional cards. Theater mode is the main story mode, featuring fully-animated cutscenes following the main character, Rickey Leon. Finally, Versus mode is a 2-player free battle mode. It is possible to optionally use and wager cards in Versus mode. There are ten characters initially available, with several more unlocked as specific conditions are met.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">MeltyLancer: Re-inforce</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-12-04</td><td>Imagineer Co., Ltd.</td><td>TENKY Co.

The game sports a high level of interactivity. Many objects in the environment can be broken or interacted with, such as pool tables, arcade machines, glass, light switches and security cameras. The protagonist is also able to hand strippers dollars to have them remove their top.The main character regularly delivers commentary on the events through one-liners.

Enemies mainly include aliens, mutated humans and members of the police force that have been turned into Pig Cops.

In Ishin no Arashi the player can choose one of the three major battles of Bakumastu period, and decide which leader will eventually propel Japan towards the Meiji era.This strategy game is somewhat similar to the better-known  Romance of the Three Kingdoms series and other  historical simulation games by  the same company, but also differs from them by having much less complex diplomacy options and focusing the gameplay on navigation and individual encounters. Before beginning, the player chooses a general and customizes his parameters (stamina, attack power, charisma, knowledge). The player then controls the general with soldiers of his choice, navigating him on grids representing towns and countryside of Japan in turn-based fashion. The grids can be occupied by shops, schools (to train the general), friendly and hostile characters and groups. Battles, as well as negotiations and diplomatic procedures, are carried out automatically, and their outcome depends on the characters' statistics.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">J.

Live commentator is present, but doesn't comment on everything but only on key elements as well as addressing players by their actual names. Camera isn't fixed and adjusts during gameplay to best show the current action, switches to back view for free kicks and penalties, zooms out if the ball is too high to show both the kicker and the ball, and otherwise works as an action camera slightly rotating angles and using zoom automatically instead of just scrolling over the soccer field. Before engaging in a match with another player or the CPU, player can also do training with a selected team where only your team players are on the field where one can test all the moves and learn the ropes.

But on his journey Kain meets many other young women, and it won't be so easy to choose one to whom he can give his heart!Labeled as Love Role-Playing, "Blue Breaker" is a genre-crossing game that combines traditional Japanese RPG with town and dungeon exploration, party-based combat, etc., with "love adventure", in which your behavior towards girls influences the story. "Blue Breaker" features branching story progressing: events appear depending on the progress you have made with your female companions. Your typical RPG activities will influence your relationship with the girls. For example, if you fight too much, the girls will be tired; if you give a girl too many orders in battle (you can set battle in auto mode and only interfere occasionally) she will be displeased, and so on.

The game lets the player control cars (of various models), boats and submarines that change according to the track.The tracks have power-ups. They can be collected and activated and have negative and positive effects. Most are standard power-ups from this type of game, like speed boosts and oil leaks. Some are more bizarre, making the vehicle bigger or smaller, or making it bounce or fly.The tracks are organized by theme and difficulty. By winning races the player receives access to increasingly more challenging tracks. The game controls are particularly sensitive, and getting out of the path often makes the vehicle explode.Instead of a fixed camera, the game usually changes angles when the vehicle reaches certain points of the track. The camera can go as low as behind the vehicle, and go high to a "bird's eye" viewpoint.Multi-player mode has its own set of tracks.

From there, taking advantage of their fast reproduction rate, the player can train new workers, and as soon as three different wooden huts are available, the council will allow the construction of a cement yard, which in turn allows the construction of better buildings. However, slobs wouldn't appreciate living in such luxury, and so a gadget factory can be built so that computers are distributed to their houses, allowing for a new generation of better educated citizens. 
While the workers pack a nasty punch when in a large group, violence should be left to the professionals. After building a Pizza Parlor, the player is allowed to use the services of gangsters. These are able to take on that pesky foreman or that building the Council asked to get rid off.But there's more to the game than just building from ghetto houses to luxury apartments, and as they say, all is fair in war, and construction IS war. The player can send their foremen to capture other teams' buildings, or do even worse: provide housing for the scum of society. From hippies to ghosts, these can do a number on the other teams' properties. Want to stress out a tenant? Send the thugs to do a wild party in their house. Need some cash or materials? Send the thief to relieve a team from them. All this while preventing the others from doing the same to you by assigning police patrols to key areas. 
As time passes, it pays out to build other, more friendly, buildings. For example, a school allows everyone to breed more civilized members of the society, the hospital allows recovery of wounds much faster, and everyone can go to the park to relax a little. Improving the rooms and giving them garden furniture is also a good way of keeping tenants happy, but jealousy can grow among neighbors. Failing to comply to tenants requests and demands will quickly turn the Council against the player.The player will have to balance the output of their tenants to achieve success: overdeveloping one aspect might make a dent in the bank account (leading to bankruptcy), cut the arrival of new workers (putting a strain on existing teams), prevent deceased tenants from being replaced (leaving houses vacant, eventually having them turn into a flaming pile of rubble not before giant cockroaches settle in), or decrease police and mob favors (necessary to patrol areas against undesirables and gangster actions). The difficulty level affects what maps can be selected, but also which  actions the undesirables can perform. To choose higher difficulty settings, more computer players (up to three) must be activated.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Cosmic Cookoff: Language Arts</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998</td><td>Lightspan, Inc.</td><td>Lightspan, Inc.</td><td>Educational</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Front of Sleeve - PlayStation (US) (from Ad Blurbs)In Cosmic Cookoff, your child will practice his or her language arts test taking skills as Mars and Cali navigate through the solar system, racing against Flinch and Wgsley in search of the perfect recipe.LEARNING OBJECTIVES

After finding out an alien creature is behind it, he is recruited into the Men in Black, a secret organization that supervises alien life on Earth. Now known as Agent J, he, along with his colleagues K and L (Tommy Lee Jones' and Linda Fiorentino's film character, respectively), protect the Earth from malevolent aliens and prevent the public from learning about the existence of extraterrestrial life.The main part of the game begins at MIB headquarters. Here, players are briefed on the next mission in the briefing room and can change their weapon and do target practice at the shooting gallery. Several different weapons are available, from realistic firearms to the futuristic guns seen in the film, including the small but powerful Noisy Cricket. Before a mission, players can choose to play as J, K or L. The three have different fighting styles and their dialogue also differs. The game includes three main missions, which send the agents to the Arctic, the Amazon and a remote island. Stylized comic-style cutscenes advance the story between levels.Missions involve exploring the surroundings, combat with aliens (either hand-to-hand or with guns) and puzzle-solving: finding keycards to open doors, restarting the computer system, or distracting a dog for a way to pass. Ammunition is limited and thus should be conserved, but can be refilled from the supplies of fallen enemies or occasional caches found in the levels.

The game involves flying a ship down a tunnel. You can move left and right along the tunnel's walls, and fire into the tunnel. You have a standard blaster, and can pick up a range of special weapons along the way. You also can pick up a 'smart bomb' type weapon, that launches a firewall down the tunnel.Enemies are all based on real world insects, and range from flies, though to mosquitos, scorpions and spiders. Each tunnel introduces one new enemy. After each tunnel has been cleared you have to defeat a larger version of that tunnel's new enemy before you can leave.Mushrooms can be collected off the tunnel walls. Once you have collected the required amount, you can enter a bonus level. These consist of open tunnels, containing two items: eggs, and spinning blades. The objective is to avoid the blades, and shoot as many eggs as you can. When you shoot an egg you get points, however the ship also speeds up making it harder to avoid the blades.At the end of the game there is a final mutant boss insect to defeat.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">NBA ShootOut 98</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998</td><td>Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc.</td><td>Sony Interactive Studios America</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This game features all 29 NBA teams from the 1998 season.

Players are rated in 18 attributes (plus some hidden attributes), and eight formations. Several tactics give the manager a lot of depth to change into the style more suitable for the footballers available. As there isn't a stat to display the overall value of a player (other than his market value), the player has to choose the starting eleven according to the desired playing style by their individual strengths: defenders with strong heading should be placed in the middle, fast dribblers in the flanks and so on, as well as using the post-match analysis statistics to see how well they performed.Like the older titles, the game uses the Kick Off engine to simulate games, in this case Kick Off 97. Other match simulation options include a 2D radar (which can quickly change to the 3D engine in key parts of the game such as goals and cards) and a CM-like text mode. If two players want to discover who has the strongest team, they can do so by choosing the "Friendly" mode.

Like in other games of its kind the player has to make his way through the levels by running left and right, jumping and using a spray attack to take out the various enemies that stand in his way. To complete a level the player has to reach a flagpole and attack it. When hit by an enemy the skunk loses one of his green orbs (which acts as hitpoints) and when all out of these a life is lost. More orbs can be earned by taking out enemies. Collectable stars can be found all around the levels and by getting a hundred of these an extra life is earned.The player will come across various extreme gears that allow him to progress through the levels. Once a gear is equipped the regular spray attack can not be used. There are six gears but only one can be equipped at a time. These include the diggers which allow the player to dig through earth in a Dig-Dug fashion, the paraglider which allows him to use air currents to his advantage, the pogo stick that allows him to jump higher, the skates which allows him to move really fast and the snowboard which allows him to gain speed on downhill slopes.

Claire Redfield, the younger sister of Chris, and Leon Kennedy, a rookie cop on his first day of the job, arrive in the sleepy midwestern town of Raccoon City only to find the city in flaming ruins due to the inhabitants having been transformed into mindless flesh-eating freaks. Although Claire and Leon team up, they are soon separated and trapped inside the city by a car crash. Seeking refuge within the Raccoon City police station, each character must find a way to escape from the nightmare while solving the mystery of what happened to Raccoon City. Besides the zombie population (which is much more diverse than the original, including teenage girl zombies, maniac cop zombies, and even melting naked zombies), Claire and Leon will also have to deal with a variety of freakish mutants including giant poisonous spiders, walking venus-fly-traps, and speedy wall-crawling Lickers. Each character will also be pursued by one seemingly unstoppable foe: a horrific and constantly evolving man-monster known as the "G-Type" (Leon's Scenario), or a taciturn but inhumanly powerful Umbrella agent who is nonetheless saddled with the rather quaint name of Mr. X (Claire's Scenario). Like the previous game in the series, Resident Evil 2 is a 3D action-adventure using three-dimensional polygon characters over two-dimensional pre-rendered backgrounds, with the action viewed through a variety of cinematic fixed camera angles in each room. Just like the original Resident Evil, players can choose to play as one of two possible characters. Each character goes through the same initial scenario, but with differences in the type of weaponry they find and the people they meet along the way. Leon will team up with a mysterious woman calling herself Ada Wong, while Claire will find herself charged with protecting a little girl named Sherry Birkin. Unlike the original Resident Evil, beating the game for the first time unlocks a second scenario to be played with the character you didn't choose, with new locations, maps, enemies, a longer and more climactic ending. Your actions in the first scenario can also affect the outcome of certain events in the second scenario. Additionally, ammo and healing items are more plentiful than in the original game, although you still aren't given enough bullets to kill every enemy you meet.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Sensible Soccer '98: European Club Edition</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998</td><td>GT Interactive Software Corp.</td><td>Sensible Software</td><td>Action, Sports</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Sensible Soccer European Club Edition is the followup sequel to Sensible Soccer '98.

For example, you can tell all the units in your army to follow your vehicle. However this can be unreliable due to poor pathfinding.There is a huge range of vehicles available for each army, from reconnaissance jeeps and bikes through heavy tanks and walkers all the way to the really special toys, laser and stealth tanks. There are air and sea assault troops available as well.You receive your mission objectives in e-mails sent from mission control (or WOPR itself) which update as you fulfill briefs. These can be as simple as 'go there, kill that' but sometimes require more complex tasks such as picking up a spy from behind enemy lines, crippling a base's SAM sites to allow an attack from the air, and so on.One major draw of the game is an enjoyable two-player co-operative mode. Using a unique split-screen view (split diagonally instead of vertical/horizontal) both players control a vehicle each, and can cycle through the rest. This can be interesting as one player lends air support while the other storms the AA sites with a tank, for example.In addition to co-operative mode, there is a head-to-head multiplayer mode available and about 30 levels in the single player mode.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Warhammer: Dark Omen</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Mindscape International Ltd.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG), Strategy</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td>Real-time</td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This sequel to Warhammer: Shadow Of The Horned Rat is an overhead role playing game in which you play Morgan Bernhardt.

Initially only a portion of sounds is available, and to unlock the rest of them the players need to play the other part of Groove Jigoku Five.The other part of the game is a collection of mini-games, or hell part-time jobs. These games are usually short and visually simplistic. On the mini-game selection screen only three random mini-games are available at each time and the players need to play more to unlock more games. They include counting people in traffic, crossing a road collecting mushrooms along the way, chopping logs, racing to the cliff, remembering the right sequence, spotting ghosts, assembling ball pens, and more. For doing these jobs the players get some money, which they can spend at vending machines, which give out random prizes. It can be either sounds for the DJ mixing console, or just random collectible pictures.Most of the mini-games were later reused in the PSP game WTF: work time fun (Baito Hell 2000) practically unchanged or with minor cosmetic iterations.

These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying  Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe & assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of enemies, and are also affected by the terrain. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Skullmonkeys</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-01-28</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Neverhood, Inc., The</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td>Comedy</td><td>Platform</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Skullmonkeys is the successor title to The Neverhood, which came out only on PC (and, in Japan, as "Klaymen Klaymen" on PSX).

Tactics combines traditional elements of the Final Fantasy series with a completely different game mechanics and battle system. It was the 1st game during the Final Fantasy 32-bit era using a 3D, isometric, rotatable playing field, with bitmap sprite characters and a turn based strategy system.In the game you build up a team by recruiting many available characters you meet during your travels and stocking up plenty of items, to defeat various enemies waiting on your path. The game features a very complex character class(job) system where each character begins his way with a job such as Squire or Chemist. Successfully participating in battles, characters can later select one of more advanced jobs, with a total of 19 to choose from. In addition there are certain monsters and computer controlled "guests" with their own jobs and special abilities available to learn. In total, over 400 abilities are available which leads to nearly endless combinations.The PSP version of the game mostly reiterates the original for the PSOne. Visual presentation is almost a 1:1 copy, looking like the old version with a zoomed-in camera to make it fit the PSP screen. Port developer Tose added cel-shaded introduction movies and numerous animation sequences played after each chapter ends. Some maps were completely remade as well, but you still cannot skip event scenes.Also the PSP version features two new playable characters: Balthier, from Final Fantasy XII and Luso from Final Fantasy Tactics A2. Two new job classes have been added - the completely new Onion Knight and the Dark Knight class which was available on the PSOne only after using a cheat code. There are two wireless multiplayer options available once you've reached the world map (just go into a bar in any town). One is Coliseum (Versus Battle Mode), the second is Cooperative Challenge (team mission).</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">MTV's Beavis and Butt-Head in Virtual Stupidity</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-01-29</td><td>B-Factory</td><td>Viacom New Media</td><td>Adventure</td><td>3rd-person (Other), Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Puzzle elements</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Beavis and Butt-Head in Virtual Stupidity is a point-and-click adventure based on MTV's Beavis & Butt-head series.

Charon is contacted by a shadowy character named Ul D-Grak, who claims to have a mission for him, and asks the assassin to meet them on the planet Kar-Naq. Charon lands on the planet near a city and proceeds to search for his mysterious client. The gameplay is from a third-person view, but the camera is always located at a set place on a map. As the player walks between different places, the camera fluidly moves from one set viewpoint to another. The gameplay has some action in it, but mostly it is adventure-style solving of puzzles or talking to people. During conversations, Charon can ask people a question about any subject he has heard about (a character, location or item), and he can assume one of three stances: meek, normal or aggressive. This is sometimes necessary to progress in a dialogue: for example, certain characters won't give Charon necessary items unless threatened.At other times Charon needs to use violent force to proceed. Charon can shoot his gun anytime, aiming at any spot visible on the screen. The gun can be used to kill enemies, or to shoot at specific parts of the environment to solve puzzles. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Rascal</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-03-01</td><td>Psygnosis Limited</td><td>Traveller's Tales (UK) Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In Rascal you must rescue your kidnapped father, a professor, from the clutches of the evil Chronon.

The setting is 16th century feudal Japan, a period when ruthless daimyo (feudal lords) contended with each other for dominance. Ultimately, the winner in this struggle will become Shogun and hold actual power over the islands, while being nominally subject to the Emperor.The game casts the player as one of the daimyo, allowing them freedom to decide the fate and future of feudal Japan, through diplomacy and ultimately war. The objective is to unify Japan under the player's rule. If the player fails through death on the battlefield, assassination at the hands of a ninja, or through natural causes, they can choose a successor and play on. Functionally, the first job is to let prosper the fief (province) under the player's control through agricultural development and town investment. There are two scenarios available in the game: 

Warlords: 1560 A.D.
The first scenario begins as the daimyo prepare what will eventually become a full scale war in the whole of Japan. The warring states period begins here. There are 28 of them included in the scenario, among others: the Mori clan, the Takeda, the Hojo clan, the Uesugi clan, etc.Nobunaga's Ambition: 1582 A.D.
The second scenario follows the rise of Oda Nobunaga in 1582 A.D. to power and allows the player to play either as Oda Nobunaga or as one of his chief allies or rivals. 

Samurai
The game improves on its predecessor by including some 400 historical samurai in the game, providing the player with generals for troops and governors for a conquered fief. Each samurai is characterized by statistics: Age, Rank, Body Points, War, Politics, Ambition, Charisma, and Loyalty. There are also additional attributes for specific military purposes: Skill, Arms Level, and Unit Type. Some of these attributes may be improved through training (i.e. war, politics, and skill), rewards (i.e. loyalty), or through merchants (i.e. arms level). Strategy
The game is turn-based, with each turn representing one month. Certain events take place annually such as tax collecting (March) and rice harvest (September), while other events, such as invading neighbors, follows the player's time table.The game uses an initiative system to determine what actions can be completed in a particular month. Each daimyo and samurai has a stock of "Body Points" that represent the attention he can afford to spend on an action. Each action has a cost in Body Points for the character executing it, and if he does not have the point’s necessary, he may not perform it. Body Points are refreshed a little each month. The level of Body Points refreshed per month is depends on the level of his Political skill. Intensive operations will deplete Body Points and then require turns of inaction to stock up again, so timing actions to coincide with Body Point availability is an extra wrinkle to the management of resources.Combat
Each samurai can lead a 100-strong unit, which must be recruited, then trained, and equipped with weapons for battle. The attack of an army results in a tactical play out of the resulting battle or siege. A hex-based map of the area of the battlefield will form the playing board for the movement to combat and actual fighting. Fortifications (castles) have a dramatic benefit for the defender. The attacker must defeat the defender within 30 days or must force a withdrawal. Additionally, both sides must pay attention to their food provisions as each day subtracts food supplies in accordance to their army size.

Unit Types
The game introduces 3 basic military unit types: Infantry (Inf), Cavalry (Cav), and Rifles (Rif). Each unit type has certain special abilities and tactical advantages/disadvantages in combat:

Infantry have the ability to ambush anywhere on the main fief map (explained later) and have 4 movement points; 
Cavalry have the ability to charge at an enemy (inflicting considerable damage on both sides) with the chance of breaking through the defending unit and emerging on the other side. Samurai leaders may often be killed (instead of captured) if their unit reaches zero. Cavalry have 6 movement points; Rifles may attack using muskets which have devastating offensive capabilities, which may also kill an enemy samurai unit if the opponent's unit reaches zero (thus, a standard non-rifle attack is also available for capturing an enemy samurai leader). Rifles have 3 movement points.
 
Additionally, both Infantry and Rifle units may move over walls or through water during the castle siege for a certain amount of movement points.Tactical Combat
Tactical combat occurs in two different locations:

The first is the tactical map of the fief, where the attackers first arrive and the defenders surrounding the castle. In this setting, each days is divided into three time periods: morning, afternoon, and night, before the day ends. At night, armies may maneuver to surprise attack enemies in the dark, which does considerably more damage than an average attack. This may be done if the enemy is at least two squares away (not adjacent).The second is the castle siege map, which occurs if the defender chooses to retreat to the castle from the previous map. Here, each turn represents one day, thus the time limit of the attack as well as the provisions of both sides, rapidly decrease with each turn. In this setting, the siege force must break down gates leading towards the castle for the final engagement. The defender is defeated, if the governor of the fief retreats, or if his unit is destroyed: resulting either in his capture or death.The end outcome is either the fall of the fief to the attacking forces or victory for the defenders. Either way, captured samurai (if any) will require a prompt response for release, beheading, or recruitment to the winner's force.

To his astonishment, three high school girls arrive and defeat the ruffians. The hero learns that those girls belong to an organization called "Matoi-gumi". Well-trained in martial arts, these girls protect the campus from hooligans and alike. The hero decides to join Matoi-gumi. Maybe he will save enough girls to make one of them grateful and become his girlfriend!Fire Woman: Matoi-gumi is an RPG, though not in the traditional sense. There are no supernatural occurrences in the game. Character growth is determined by training, not by fighting enough battles to level up. Learning martial arts, playing basketball, participating in chemistry class - everything has an effect on the hero's parameters. There are no random battles in the game; the fights are story-related and usually occur when the hero attempts to rescue a girl. The battles are turn-based, but have a timer for each turn; before the time runs out, the player has to input a combination of four moves for the hero (including punches, kicks, etc.). There is also a "dating sim" element in the game. "Important" girls can be seen on a special screen called "GPS" ("Gal Positioning System"). If they are in trouble, they will have sweat on their faces. It is up to the player to decide whether to rescue the girl or not. Sometimes it is possible to become friendly with the girl through other means, such as participating in a club she likes. Walking the girl home increases her affection. By the end of the game, the hero will end up with the girl who likes him most and whom he has spent the most time with. The game has a schedule, keeping track of events such as holidays, girls' birthdays, etc., though the actual game is not real-time - a day ends when the player decides to have the hero go home, or as a conclusion of a story-related event.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Kindaichi Shōnen no Jikenbo: Jigoku Yūen Satsujin Jiken</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-03-26</td><td>Kodansha Ltd.</td><td>Digital Frontier</td><td>Adventure</td><td>1st-person</td><td>Licensed</td><td>Detective / mystery</td><td>Visual novel</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Narrative</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Jigoku Yuuen Satsujin Jiken (地獄遊園殺人事件) is the second game from Kindaichi Case Files series for PlayStation console (overall third released game in the series), often referred to as Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo 2. The story protagonist is Hajime Kindaichi (金田一一), a high school student, and more importantly a grandson of a renowned private detective after whom he inherited a knack for solving crimes by using deduction and reasoning similar in style to Shinichi Kudou in Detective Conan series.Miyuki Nanase (七瀬美雪), Hajime's childhood friend got tickets for Shell Park, which is a resort with a sea theme split in four areas: Fantasy World, Aqua World, Adventure World, and Visitor World. After waking up Haime from his rather romantic dream, she storms out towards the park. During his pursuit of her and constant quarrel along the road, they spot a police car with detective Kenmochi heading somewhere. Not too far away, they come upon a crime scene where the victim was found hanging from a tree. It doesn't take but a few good looks for Kindaichi to point that this is not a suicide but a homicide. As they arrive at the Shell Park, after a little wondering they stumble upon a dead body near the jet coaster, and a small explosion takes out the "S" letter from the park's sign turning what's left of it to look like a Hell Park.With so many people and staff around, the culprit could be anybody, but Kindaichi isn't going home until he roots out the evil and find the murderer. The game plays in two different ways. Adventure part is done through a typical visual novel conversation where all the characters feature voice acting and every scene is animated. Characters on the scene are animated while talking or just standing idly, while characters who are talking but not visible on the scene get animated in a small window in front of the displayed dialogue text. Exploration mode uses 1st-person perspective where you can move freely in 3D world of Shell Park. Dialogues also use the very same 3D scene as a background images, while cut-scenes use fully anime-like.The game includes a couple of bonus materials enclosed within the manual, namely, a map of Shell Park which is double in width and height to a jewel case manual, and stickers featuring game title and main two characters (Hajime and Miyuki) which are designed to work as a PSX memory card stickers.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Naniwa Wangan Battle</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-03-26</td><td>Medioza</td><td>MTO Co., Ltd.</td><td>Racing / Driving</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Contemporary, Japan (Modern/Futuristic)</td><td>Automobile, Street racing</td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Naniwa Wangan Battle is a street racing game set in Osaka, Japan.

While the Prime Evils of Hell were engaged in war their lesser lieutenants conspired to overthrow them. They mutinied suddenly with the combined forces of Hell, overwhelming the three Primes. Stripped of their power, they were banished to the mortal realm. Human agents of Heaven, upon discovering this, found the three Primes and sealed them within gemstone prisons, each of them sent to a different corner of the earth and kept under guard to prevent them from escaping.As years turns to centuries, however, the power of Heaven's agents waned, until eventually not even the people of the town of Tristram knew that buried deep under their chapel was the soul of the Lord of Terror, Diablo. As the strength of his prison waned Diablo reached out into the world, corrupting the dreams of the land's good king, driving him to attack his neighbors. The nation of Khanduras fought wars with no intention of winning, desiring only slaughter and suffering. Now the lands lay scorched, home only to monsters and the dead. Rumors spread of a way to stop the demons, as well as rumors of great wealth, and both draw adventurers from far to the small town of Tristram.Players start by choosing their avatar's class: either Warrior, Rogue, or Sorcerer. Warriors have the highest maximum strength and can repair weapons and armor inside the dungeon, but this will lower the item's maximum durability. The Rogue has the highest maximum dexterity and can both see and disarm traps on treasure chests. The Sorcerer has the highest maximum magic attribute and can recharge the charges on a spellcasting staff at the cost of his own mana.Characters can equip armor, weapons, and accessories found in the chapel's shifting dungeons, but strong equipment will have minimum attribute requirements to be worn. Most equipment will have randomized stats, but some strong monsters will drop Unique weapons with set stats. Magic can be learned by finding magic tomes, and leveled up by finding multiples of the same spell tome, but advanced spell levels can not be learned if the character's magic stat is too low. Upon destroying enough monsters to level up the player is rewarded with additional attribute points to distribute to whichever attributes they wish. Occasionally the few people left in town will inform the player of a job they would like done, either an exceptionally strong monster that must be slain or a unique item found deep in the dungeon, and will reward the player in kind upon completion of the quest.Diablo can be played cooperatively with 1 to 3 other players over LAN or BattleNet with the PC versions, or with 1 player locally on the PlayStation. Players can team up to survive the depths of the dungeons, or turn on each other to steal one another's items from their corpse. The quest unique zones are removed from the online version of a dungeon, and instead quest monsters will be found wandering the level that would normally lead to their unique area.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Ian Livingstone's Deathtrap Dungeon</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-03-31</td><td>Eidos Interactive, Inc.</td><td>Asylum Studios</td><td>Action</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Fang was once a proud and rich city, until Baron Sukumvit took over. Under his rule, the city is known as the City of the Lost Souls. Deep inside the mountains surrounding the city, Baron Sukumvit built a labyrinth, named Deathtrap Dungeon, and used it to imprison his enemies. Filled with vulgarities, traps and disgusting monsters, the dungeon is a very dangerous place. With his enemies gone, the Baron now has opened up the dungeon to sport and sends willing heroes down into it's depths, betting on the likelihood of their survival.  If anyone could survive all levels of the dungeon, and slay the red dragon Melkor,  they would receive 10.000 gold pieces and Baron Sukumvit would renounce his rule over Fang.

There are several additional rooms, such as a staff room for your employees to rest, a toilet so that patients don't have to relieve themselves in the corridors, a research department to get the most advanced diagnostic and treatment technologies and a training room where consultants can teach a thing or two to rookies, making them capable doctors.

This means you must clear a stage by reaching its finish line before your "Anergy"(sic) runs out, and then battling the corresponding boss creature/machine in an individual stage.As mentioned, your bike can change into several modes, each with  its pros and cons (robot mode is slow but combat-oriented, bike mode is fast but weak, and buggy mode is slower but easier to maneuver). You'll need to use them all however, as each stage is filled with enemies and traps. Combat is handled mainly in robot mode and depending on the amount of enemies you hit simultaneously, a combo meter fills up that can be used to unleash super moves (useful for clearing enemies and mines).

Each disk contains a fragment of a recording; gradually, the backstory is revealed as Klaymen finds more and more disks. It would spoil too much to reveal the exact plot, as finding it out is part of the game. The Neverhood is a point-and-click adventure game, notable for its claymation graphics. It uses a simple interface: you move and interact with the world by clicking on the screen. There is no inventory screen, though Klaymen can find a few items he can pick up. There are few inventory-based puzzles; most of the puzzles involve solving riddles and interacting with the environment.

Offering the classic mix of arcade and simulated gameplay from the previous games, this edition updates the game twelve different types of tournaments and cups, eleven international leagues, 120 national teams and about 30 different stadia to play in.Aside from the classic gameplay players have different moves such as flick-passes, short dribbles, and sliding tackles. In both (arcade modes and simulation), there is a speed button that makes players run at an extreme and somewhat unrealistic speed. It is not entirely an advantage as using it widens the gap between the ball and the foot, leaving players wide open for tackles. Unlike similar games, there also isn't a way to scroll through the available players - the game automatically selects the player nearest to the ball.The camera is dynamic and smoothly zooms in and out to give the best overview of the pitch. Multiplayer is available for up to four players through multitap.

In 2242, war breaks out again - the Earth slowly begins to win... except for the efforts of an experimental Selene technology known as Einhänders: flying machines with a "hand" that allows them to change weaponry mid-battle.On December 12, 2245, Selene sends down 3 Einhänders in a last attempt to turn the tide of the war. You get to choose the craft to pilot, and it's up to you to battle your way through the Earth's monstrous defenses and win the battle.The game is a traditional side-scrolling shooter, with rendered 3D backgrounds and enemies. The atmosphere of the game is very "industrial", down to the German industrial music playing in the background (think Einsturzende Neubauten mixed with Lords of Acid). The weapon-switching and claiming is an integral part of the game, as weapons have limited shots.

You control one of the chosen ones who were destined to fight and destroy the Garan.Gameplay is similar to that of Tenchu, in a third-person view, as you run around the streets of villages in search of magic power-ups and the different coloured crystals before the Garan find them for their power.Fighting also resembles the system of Tenchu, as you engage enemies using your weapons to injure your opponents or to block their attacks. You also have magic as another weapon to use against them. Combos are easily achieved and different weapons work better, or not at all on some enemies, so magic must be used.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">The King of Fighters '97</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-05-28</td><td>SNK Corporation</td><td>SNK Corporation</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td>Regional differences</td><td></td><td>Fighting</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Another year, another KOF. Additions this year come in the form of slightly improved graphics and sounds, new moves and a new game mode. Gameplay is much more plot-driven, as you have middle-bosses that can change depending on what team you select. In addition, there are several special endings which are only shown when certain "Edit Team" combinations are selected.As of The King of Fighters '97, you can play in either the Extra or Advanced game modes. Extra Mode is the typical AOF/KOF scheme, in which your power gauge fills up as you defend yourself or charge yourself up. The new Advanced Mode, on the other hand, only allows you to charge your gauge as you perform special moves and attacks, similar to the Street Fighter series. Extra allows one to sidestep attacks while Advanced allows the character to roll past and dodge attacks; Advanced also allow a character to perform a potent "Super Desperation Move" (or SDM) at any time provided the character has at least two full bars of charged energy stored. In contrast, SDMs can only be performed in Extra when a character has less than a quarter of their health left.New characters include the New Face Team, the Fatal Fury Outlaw Team (featuring the KOF debut of "Blue" Mary Ryan and Ryuji Yamazaki, and the return of Billy Kane), and Kyo's pupil Shingo Yabuki. In total, The King of Fighters '97 sports 29 separate characters (without counting the six Orochi-related boss characters, which are all accessible via a secret code).</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Road Rash 3-D</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-05-31</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Action, Racing / Driving</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Motorcycle, Street racing</td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Road Rash 3-D is a 3D installment of the motorcycle racing game in which participants utilize violent tactics to win. The gameplay is quite similar to that of the previous games: the player-controlled racer must avoid oncoming cars and obstacles on the road, beating opponents with metal pipes, crowbars, and other assorted damage-inflicting tools. The player wins money upon the completion of the race, and eventually can afford to buy better bikes. The courses are formed from connecting points in an environmental grid, which means that the player can utilize different stretches of courses to advance.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Azure Dreams</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-06-01</td><td>Konami of America, Inc.</td><td>KCE Tokyo, Inc.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Regional differences</td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The huge Monster Tower stands near the village Monsbaiya. It is populated by vicious monsters, and few dare enter it. But the monsters in the tower lay eggs, and whoever takes possession of such an egg, can tame a monster which will come out of it, and those monsters, called "familiars", will help their tamers in times of danger. Some brave adventurers dared to enter the tower and to take the eggs. One of them was called Guy. He was killed in the monster tower. Now his son Koh is fifteen, and he is allowed to try his luck in the tower.The player controls Koh and his party of "familiars" in this dungeon crawling/monster taming RPG. Each floor of the tower is randomly generated when entered, including the layout, items, and traps within it, although the enemy monsters that appear are based on the current floor number. Movement and combat in the game is turn-based; first Koh moves, then allied familiars, then enemy monsters, but outside of combat enemy turns happen instantly. Because Koh's level is reset to 1 every time he enters the tower he has to depend on equipment, a sword and a buckler, and familiars. A familiar's MP will slowly deplete as it follows Koh, however, and they must be periodically fed with appropriate food or they will become unresponsive. As in most Mysterious Dungeon type games Koh will lose all items, even carefully upgraded equipment, if he is defeated in the tower, so fleeing the tower is always a valid strategy.Once back in town the player can hatch any found monster eggs into permanent familiars and sell off loot from the tower. This money can then be reinvested in the town to add new buildings, decorate Koh's house, unlock minigames, and to show up Koh's rival Ghosh, a rich pretty-boy who never lifted a finger to help Monsbaiya. As Koh restores the town he also meets new female love interests, who over the course of several dungeon trips can be befriended and eventually become close confidants. Koh's familiars retain levels earned in the dungeon, and by carefully merging familiars they can be upgraded with skills they otherwise could never acquire.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Frenzy!</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-06-01</td><td>SCi (Sales Curve Interactive) Ltd.</td><td>SCi (Sales Curve Interactive) Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td></td><td>Flight / aviation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Frenzy is a 3D shoot 'em up in which the player controls a small biplane.

Neither side could gain the upper hand until the Imperial Wizardry designed a weapon with too much destructive power. Causing the planet's axis to shift, the deployment of the weapon resulted in the melting of polar ice, which led to a world-wide flood. Four wise men designed a mechanism that allowed the planet's four continents to float above the water. For generations, the secrets of maintaining the mechanism have been passed from the wise men to their descendants. But now, the last of those are gone, and the planet begins to sink into the vast ocean.Eon is a young man who lives on the continent of Shilf with his foster father. One day, he discovers the powers of a magical orb he found when he was a child. Seeing these powers, Eon's foster father realizes that he might be connected to the wise men of the past. Eon must find the only person who can fix the continent-raising mechanism, and prevent a terrible disaster.The Granstream Saga is an action game with strong RPG elements, and a spiritual successor to Gaia games. The player controls Eon as he explores overworld and dungeon locations, which are presented in overhead-viewed 3D. Battles are one-on-one; whenever an enemy is encountered, the view is zoomed on the combat participants who must fight each other until one of them emerges victorious. Eon can use swords, daggers, or axes against his enemies. He has a variety of attack moves at his disposal, including combos, shield-breaking abilities, etc.; he can also actively guard and cast magic spells. Leveling up, which increases Eon's attributes, occurs at set intervals throughout the game rather than from accumulating experience points. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Atelier Marie Plus: Salburg no Renkinjutsushi</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-06-04</td><td>Gust Co., Ltd.</td><td>Gust Co., Ltd.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Isometric</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Atelier Marie Plus is an updated version of the original title which features a variety of extra bonus materials unlocked after the game is completed.

An organization known as OMAR (Oil Monopoly Alliance Regime) was making money off the shortage everywhere except in the United States. OMAR hires the best terrorist that $100 million could buy: Sid Burn. His job, aided by five hired Coyotes, is to destroy all gas refineries in the southwest of the U.S. so OMAR can bring the country to its knees. When gas prices went wild, six civilians who called themselves Vigilantes, led by the truck driver Convoy, began fighting against the Coyotes in different areas to keep OMAR from succeeding.Vigilante 8 is a vehicular combat game similar to Twisted Metal in concept. Players can choose from eight characters with different agendas, and select vehicles ranging from classic 1970's muscle cars to a school bus, each stacked high with various kinds of weapons. Unlockables include two hidden levels (three in the Nintendo 64 version) and five hidden characters and cars.

Suddenly, a terrible storm comes out of nowhere: Yukiya is washed out on the shore. He regains consciousness, but not memories of recent events. Realizing that he is on an island, he begins to explore it and reaches a big mansion. To his surprise, his friends are already there; apparently, they have all been invited. Thinking that the worst is behind, Yukiya goes to sleep. But the next day, the young and beautiful owner of the mansion, Chiori Nakamura, is found dead in a locked room. One of Yukiya's companions reveals herself as the famous detective Edogawa Ranko (perhaps  Conan's older sister; definitely a reference to the Japanese crime novel author Edogawa Ranpo). Under her guidance, the group decides to investigate the murder, but it turns out that the mansion is cut off the rest of the world. They are stuck on the island, and one of them might be a murderer...Yakata: Nightmare Project is an RPG with detective/mystery thematics rarely seen in games of its genre. Unlike most RPGs, it is set in an isolated environment; much of the gameplay is dedicated to exploration of the huge mansion and its surrounding, with conversation and event-triggering reminiscent of Japanese adventure games.The game is done in 3D, the exploration process featuring third-person perspective movement with automatically adjusted camera angles. It is also possible to physically move on the island map (also in 3D), accessing locations displayed on it. The actual RPG system is quite simple, with traditional random enemy encounters and turn-based mechanics. Battles take place on separate isometric screens. The combat distinguishes itself from other representatives of the genre by having offensive and defensive turns. During a defensive turn, the player can choose to defend, reducing the damage, or move to another place on the battle screen, hoping to avoid the attack.Anime-style full-motion movie are used to advance the story. The most important dialogues feature voice acting.

A rumor is heard that in this underground world hide the followers of a mysterious cult, known as the Dark Messiah. At the same time a symbiotic life form escapes from scientists and makes it's way into the sewer system. There it causes the crash of a subway train and starts devouring the passengers on board.

Controlling the nameless hero, the player must travel through the underground and protect Naomi. There is only one monster in the whole game, the "creature" itself, which is invulnerable and cannot be killed. Instead players are constantly on the run from it, making sure it does not catch them. The game is divided into large maze-like levels, each one usually populated by the creature who keeps pursuing the player (although he does change form after each level). At certain points there will be companions who can attack the monster and temporarily stun him. There are also people to talk to in the underground world, items to pick up, and puzzles to solve.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">X-Men vs. Street Fighter</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-06-11</td><td>Capcom Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Capcom Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Fighting</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">X-Men vs. Street Fighter is a fighting game, the first in which characters from the Marvel Comics universe (in this case, the X-Men) compete against Capcom's own creations, the heroes of the Street Fighter series.The X-Men characters are mostly the same as in X-Men: Children of the Atom and Marvel Super Heroes; three new characters are Rogue, Gambit and Sabretooth. The Street Fighter cast is based on that of Street Fighter Alpha 2; however, the appearance and combat styles of some of them have been altered, to match the abilities of the X-Men heroes.The gameplay system is similar to that of the aforementioned games, adding a tag-team gameplay feature. The player controls one character at a time, while the other awaits off-screen. The starting character can tag the waiting one in at any time by hitting specific buttons; the tag partner will jump in with an attack and taunt the enemy. Resting character gradually recuperate their health. The two partners can execute the so-called "variable attacks", which depend on the combination of buttons pressed.The tag team feature has been omitted from the PlayStation version due to memory limitations.

Dr. Light manages to make Rockman and his friends (the robots from the first Mega Man) immune to the evil computer and they set off to stop Dr. Wiley once again on the island where he's hiding.The game plays out like an interactive anime tv mini-series where each disc in the game is an "episode" with opening and ending credits. The player basically follows the plot through numerous movie clips and every now and then is asked to make decisions, be it a reply to a character, the left or right path, or even some quick time events. Aside from this the player is also thrown into battles at certain key points of the game, where the game switches to a static first person view in which the player has to kill whatever enemy or boss has crossed Rockman's path.In true Mega Man/Rockman fashion, Rockman absorbs the powers of any boss he defeats along the way, to be used against another boss later on in the game or any difficult enemies he encounters.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Double Cast</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-06-25</td><td>Sony Computer Entertainment Japan</td><td>Sugar & Rockets, Inc.</td><td>Adventure</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td>Thriller</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Cinematic camera</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Double Cast is the first of four Yaru Dora (やるドラ) interactive anime dramas that play as an actual move with player's choice branching the story.

Each one of them tries to get a hold of the remaining jewels to fulfill their dreams - some of them seek peace while others want to satisfy their hunger for power.Puchi Carat takes its inspiration from the video game classic Breakout. The player has to clear rows of gems with a ball launched from a cursor that can only move horizontally on the bottom of the screen. In regular intervals, the stones will move one row towards the bottom. Once they reach a line just above the cursor, the game is over. New rows of jewels also appear if the player is unable to catch the ball and it bounces off the floor on the very bottom of the screen.The single player mode has four different variations. In trial mode, the player has to destroy a certain amount of rows to advance to the next level. Story mode pits the player against the computer in a split screen fashion. It is possible to send rows of stones to the other player in three different modes, depending on the attack pattern the player selected. The third mode is time attack: here the player competes for the fastest time destroying 50 rows of gems. The final mode is called rapid mode where the player competes for the highest number of rows they destroyed.It is also possible to play against a human opponent. In this mode, difficulty and handicaps can be selected by the players. The player who wins the most rounds is the winner of the multiplayer match.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Real Bout Garō Densetsu Special: Dominated Mind</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-06-25</td><td>SNK Corporation</td><td>SNK Corporation, Yumekobo Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Fighting</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">A PSX-only Fatal Fury released as a conversion of sorts to Real Bout Fatal Fury Special.

In towns you can move between multiple areas as well as look at objects and people to examine or talk to them. Lina will often get into (occasionally voiced) conversations with her companions, and in most conversations choices can come up that determine if the party receives stat upgrades or money. In battle each character in the party can be controlled either manually, or left up to an automated AI. Most characters can use magic, but each spell has a wait time that prevents a character from casting more magic until enough turns have passed. Characters do not gain strength or money from battle, instead strength is determined by how rested and full the stomachs of the characters are before combat.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">The Legend of Heroes I &amp; II</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-06-25</td><td>GMF</td><td>Nihon Falcom Corp.</td><td>Compilation, Role-playing (RPG)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The Legend of Heroes I & II is a bundle composed of two games of the Legend of Heroes series:

In order to stop them, giant combat robots were deployed to a space station under the command of Colonel Goofy Reagan. The combat robots are navigated by the best pilots, which happen to be cute teenage girls. Since the Colonel is very busy, he needs somebody to watch over the girls and train them. This somebody would be Major David Lowe, the protagonist of the game...Little Cats is somewhat similar to  Sakura Taisen games, with adventure and dating elements reduced, and simulation elements added. David has to make schedules for the girls and decide how much and what exactly they should train. Running competitions, shooting range, robot navigation - everything can be trained, but at the expense of the girls' stamina, which means they will need to rest as well. During the simulation mode, it is also possible to wander around the space station and spend time with the girls.The strategy part consists of navigating the robots over a battle field in turn-based fashion. The robots have a wide range of attacks, and it is possible to change their weapons and use items in combat. Once the robots attack each other, an automatic attack sequence is shown.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Crime Killer</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-06-26</td><td>Interplay Entertainment Corp.</td><td>Pixelogic Limited</td><td>Racing / Driving</td><td>1st-person, 3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This is a driving game in the same style as Carmageddon.

Stealing cars, doing jobs for the gangsters and behaving generally anti-social are the way to success.The action moves through six levels spread over three different cities, each based on a real US city: Liberty City (based on New York City), San Andreas (based on San Francisco) and Vice City (based on Miami). To finish a level, a certain score must be reached. Stealing cars and crashing into traffic, driving over pedestrians and killing cops all raise the score, but the 
big points are made through jobs. Answering phones or entering special cars brings mission assignments, from simple "ditch-a-hot-car" jobs to supporting bank robberies or carrying out assassinations. Completing a mission will raise the score substantially and also increase the score multiplier, so that completing the next felony will gain even more points.Criminal behavior comes with a price of course: if policemen witness a crime, the player's wanted level rises. At the lowest level, a single police car might give chase, whereas at the highest level whole car squads hunt the player, the police set up roadblocks and shoot to kill. The only way to evade the cops is to find a respray shop and get a new paint job with new license plates. This costs money which is deducted from the score, however. But even dying or being arrested are not the end. The player has several lives, and ending up in jail simply results in being stripped of all weapons and armor and the score multiplier being lowered.The entire action is viewed from a top-down perspective, which zooms out while driving a car, for a better overview at high speeds. The cities are many screens large and can be freely explored. Crates are scattered over the cities, which might include weapons (from pistols to rocket launchers), armor or other bonus items: extra lives, police bribes (used to reduce the wanted level to zero) and get-out-of-jail-free cards (used to retain score multiplier and weapons when busted). Dozens of different vehicles are available for the taking, each with unique characteristics: a bus will handle very differently than a sports car.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Ark of Time</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-07-01</td><td>Project Two Interactive BV</td><td>Trecision S.p.A.</td><td>Adventure</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td>Detective / mystery</td><td>Puzzle elements</td><td></td><td></td><td>Point and select</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In this third-person point-and-click adventure game you play the sports journalist Richard Kendall.

It's possible to tweak options such as the level of control ("trainer" leaves the player only in control of player tactics and squad selection, "accountant" is the exact opposite, giving the player control over transfers, contracts, staff, finance, board room options and ground expansions, but no limited control over the squad, "Manager" gives control in all but contract deals and "total" gives full executive control) or if players age and eventually retire, or play forever.Up to 20 players can play in Manager mode, 8 in Pro-Manager.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Spice World</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-07-01</td><td>Psygnosis Limited</td><td>Team SOHO</td><td>Simulation</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Music / rhythm</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Spice World is a music game about the British quintet the Spice Girls, released at the peak of their success and prior to the departure of Geri Halliwell for a solo career.Choose your favourite Spice Girl and use samples from their songs to create your own great song.

In the far future, four planetary superpowers (the Earth Dominion, the Mercury League, the Venus Alliance and the Mars Combine) are vying for control of the solar system and on the brink of all-out "thermostellar war".  As commander of the United Planet Nations peacekeeping fighter squadron, your role is to maintain the balance and prevent cold war and localized conflicts from escalating into open interplanetary hostilities.  Further complicating the matter, you must deal with pirates and a looming alien threat.As each planetary superpower launches low-intensity strikes (as opposed to open warfare) against the colonies and outposts of the other three, you are presented with the choice, via a strategic solar system map showing flaring geopolitical hotspots, of which to aid. If you aid one superpower too much at the expense of the others, as one is first tempted to do, you upset the balance and cause the war you sought to prevent. Whichever you choose, afterward you are realistically presented with complaints and political propaganda from the other three superpowers, and receive news broadcasts concerning the interplanetary geopolitical wrangling.In addition to keeping the peace, you also manage research and development of newer and more powerful technologies, which will eventually prove crucial.  Several fighter and weapon types are available, and the scenery varies from asteroid belts and dust clouds to planetary surfaces.  You may choose from several wingmen, each with a personal description and personality type, whom you must do your best to keep alive.  Missions include such tasks as defending mine complexes from attack (or attacking them) and protecting convoys (or destroying them).The game also allows Arcade Mode, in which you simply fly missions without regard to the strategic aspects of the game, and multiplayer games of up to 8 players over TCP/IP or serial connections.

Like in Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures, players don't control the cats or even have strong influence over them. Instead, cats have a mind of their own; players interact with different items in the room in the hopes they can coax cats into doing what they want. As cats wander the room, players are able to do many different things: pick cats up, move furniture and props around, bring out toys to play with them. If the players do a good job bringing cats close to each other, at the end of the stage the two cats will form a positive relationship with each other, but if players fail to bring the cats close enough with each other they have to try the stage over again.

Energy and movement are completely redefined in this unique blend of arcade and strategy elements. You, only known as an intelligent presence, move about the landscape by teleporting between robot "hulls".  Any object in your field of vision can be absorbed for energy, as long as you also see the square of the landscape that the object is standing on.  By aiming at any square your can see, and spending energy, you can create a new robot hull and teleport your presence to it, or you can create neutral objects: trees to block yourself from the Sentinel's gaze, or boulders that can be stacked.  You gain height in the landscape by creating a robot on top of a stack of boulders, until you can see the Sentinel's square at the highest point in the landscape and absorb him.  The problem is that the Sentinel slowly rotates and ruthlessly absorbs anything in his field of vision that is more potent than a tree, including yourself.  In later levels, his sentries will threaten you with absorption from several directions.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">DBZ: Dead Ball Zone</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-09-01</td><td>GT Interactive Software Corp.</td><td>Rage Games Ltd.</td><td>Action, Sports</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This high speed futuristic sports game pits two teams of armed psychotics against each other in a brutal (and lethal) fight to launch a ball into the opponents net over, around, or through the opponent.

One day Andy and Whiskey are strolling through the park, when suddenly a solar eclipse darkens the sky, and after a moment Andy realizes that his dog has been taken away. But science can solve everything, and Andy heads to his treehouse, which is home to his outstanding inventions, including a spaceship! If you thought it was just a toy, you thought wrong, because Andy boards the ship and pilots it into the heart of the Darklands, a world controlled by the evil Master of Darkness. Andy takes out his gun (another splendid invention of his) and prepares to fight the evil sorcerer's minions. Nothing will stop the boy from rescuing his beloved dog!Heart of Darkness is a cinematic 2D platformer designed by  Eric Chahi, the creator of one of the genre's progenitors,  Another World. Though the game has many fast and furious action sequences, including shooting hordes of dark creatures, it is built like a series of tasks, each requiring different approaches, from arcade-style shooting or jumping to interacting with the environment and solving puzzles. Like its spiritual predecessor, the game is linear; completing a section usually takes Andy to a different location, where another task awaits him.Andy has several guns at his disposal, though in certain locations he will lose his weapons and will rely on the player's wit or quick reaction to survive. Andy will also gain magical energy, which can be used to grow or destroy trees. Similarly to Another World, many hazards are placed on the hero's path; despite the child-oriented premise, the game contains graphically explicit death scenes, which occur if the player is not careful or quick enough to save Andy from a gruesome demise.Heart of Darkness features orchestral music and pre-rendered animated cutscenes. It comes with a pair of 3D glasses, which allow the player to view certain scenes in the game in 3D.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Parasite Eve</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-09-09</td><td>Square Electronic Arts L.L.C.</td><td>Square Co., Ltd., Square USA, Inc.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td>Detective / mystery</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Real-time</td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">An ordinary day in New York for rookie police officer Aya Brea. Christmas Eve is the present day, and you've decided to visit the opera theater. Now this is where the fireworks begin. Suddenly audience members are set on fire, toasted completely, and it appears that the lead vocal is the source of this burning terror. Yet you appear to be immune, and as a police officer you're always on duty, so you must confront the danger.There has to be some connection between the two of you, as that seems the only rational explanation. What if mitochondria are a species on its own, more advanced then humankind, and using them only to create environments and civilization for themselves? What if humankind are just hosts? What if mitochondria are the natural enemy of humankind? That would make Aya their natural enemy, so the battle for survival and uncovering the truth has already started.The game is played over six days, each day bringing its own quest. Environments range from Central Park and the American Museum of Natural History to a police office and hospital, all of them modeled like realistic places and most of them crawling with bloodthirsty mutant animals. Combat is different from traditional RPGs, as while you still take turns attacking and/or using parasite powers, you'll be able to run across the battlefield and dodge enemy fire or even strike from a better angle or behind. As Aya levels up she will gain access to parasite powers, such as healing or supercharging a bullet with energy. These powers will deplete a recharging energy bar, although the bar will recharge slower the longer combat drags on. Aya will find many guns of various types throughout the game, and every gun can be modified with extra stats, either with special items, or by breaking down another gun to move over its bonus stats or special effects. The same is true for armor Aya finds.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Spyro the Dragon</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-09-09</td><td>Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc.</td><td>Insomniac Games, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>Behind view</td><td>Regional differences</td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The evil Gnasty Gnorc has turned all the dragons in the Dragon Lands into crystal.

Along the usual and almost obligatory NHL roster updates, the International mode first featured in the previous version was expanded, allowing players to choose IIHF rules and rink size.Graphically, the arena is more detailed with more rinkside features, and ice reflections, player faces were improved and stand more seamlessly into the model, enhanced motion capture result in better animated hits (with the ability to break the glass with a well-placed body check making a return), shots and saves, and finally an higher polygon count complete the graphic enhancements to the game.As graphic changes aren't enough to make a game better, gameplay was also tweaked, with computer players being smarter, both in offense and defense. Shooting was tweaked (slap shots are easier to pull, players no longer skate in circles to do some backhand shots and must be facing the goal to shoot, particularly in one timers) and a new special move brings dekes, spin-o-ramas and the kind of moves Jágr, Fedorov and Selänne pull when one-on-one with the goalie. However, if the player gets too close to the crease, the referee might want to review the play in the new video goal judge, so the player must think twice before trying to pull a "Brett Hull". For newcomers to the sport, a new Beginner mode allows players to get used to the ice without having to concern with penalties or an overly strong opponent.The season mode was also improved, with the players now having streaks that affect either positively or negatively his abilities.

The Arcanes are the natives on the planet Xsarra.  The Teknos crash land on Xsarra and decide to conquer the planet in this unholy war of flesh vs. metal.The Teknos are cybernetic conquerors who want the resources of Xsarra for themselves.  The Arcanes have coexisted peacefully for thousands of years but now band together to destroy the machine invaders.  Each side is compromised of seven different types of warriors for a total of 14 playable warriors.  Each warrior has three separate types of moves or attacks that can be performed against their opponent.  Each warrior also has a strategy skill that can be used when playing that mode of gameplay.There are two types of gameplay, Mayhem mode and Strategy Mode.  Mayhem mode consists of choosing seven warriors and facing off against seven opposing warriors controlled by the computer or another player.  Action is fast, furious, and different each time depending on one of the several "terrains" that can be chosen to fight the battles within.  Random power-ups also appear to help which ever warrior can get to them first.  All the warriors and environments are rendered in full 3D with the camera centering on the middle point above the two warriors.  The warriors dance around each other, hurling their attacks and avoiding traps.Strategy Mode consists of a three-dimensional map where the player moves his warriors across it with the ultimate goal to destroy the opposing warriors or destroy their fortresses.  When two warriors meet on the map, gameplay switches to Mayhem mode and the two warriors fight to the death with the winning one returning to the map to fight another day.  To create new warriors, a special type of energy called "Aur" must be mined.  Warriors in strategy mode can perform two types of actions.  These include moving, attacking, or using their special power.  There is a underlying story that is never fully developed but, is revealed as the player progresses through each of the 12 regions of the Strategy mode for both the Arcanes and Teknos.A great deal of strategy is required to win in Mayhem mode and Strategy mode.  Primarily, it involves figuring out which warrior to use to destroy another.  Each warrior has at least one fatal weakness when matched with the appropriate opposing warrior.  </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">A Collection of Activision Classic Games for the Atari 2600</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-09-23</td><td>Activision, Inc.</td><td>LTI Gray Matter</td><td>Compilation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">A collection of 30 classic Activision and Imagic titles originally published for the Atari 2600:

However, one of the magicians betrayed the Guild and used the portal for his own gain, releasing hostile creatures known as Lucifer Hawk onto Earth. Twenty-four years later, a special all-female unit known as Attacked Mystification Police was formed to combat the enemy.Case: Titanic is based on the manga and anime Silent Möbius. It presents an original episode that involves the sighting of a strange ship in the clouds above Tokyo. Closer inspection reveals that the ship appears to be identical to the famous RMS Titanic that sank in the Atlantic Ocean in 1912. The game's nameless male protagonist boards the ship along with Rally, Kiddy, Nami and other heroines from the manga in order to investigate this seemingly inexplicable phenomenon.The gameplay is done in Japanese-style, puzzle-less adventure format. The entire game is set on the Titanic. The player is generally free to visit various areas of the ship in any order, though access to certain locations is restricted and necessary events must be triggered in order to gain it.

Super Robot Wars F and  Super Robot Wars F Final (also known as "Super Robot Taisen F Kanketsuhen") were originally thought as an unique title but due to production delays the game was split in two parts. F covers the first 34 stages of the game, F Final deals with stages from 35 to the end of the game. It's possible to import a savegame from F and continue the game from here or to start F Final from scratch with default settings and units.Gameplay mechanics are the same of Super Robot Wars 4. The title is a turn based strategic game. When attacked by an enemy, the player can react in three ways: counter, evade (halves enemy % of landing an attack on the player) or defend (if hit, the player receives only half of the damage).</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Master of Monsters: Disciples of Gaia</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-10-13</td><td>ASCII Entertainment Software, Inc.</td><td>SystemSoft</td><td>Strategy</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td>Isometric</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Masters of Monsters is an anime, turn bases strategy / combat game.

The humans perceive them as demons, and invade their country. Fearing that they might lose the war, the Timenoids brainwash a human girl named Millennia, effectively turning her into a tool to serve their purposes. They put her in charge of defending their castle by entrapping the human invaders. But Millennia has yet to choose whose side she will eventually be on...Kagero: Deception II is the sequel to Tecmo's Deception. It follows a similar, hard-to-classify gameplay style, which can be perhaps defined as a real-time strategy game with RPG elements. Instead of commanding troops and units, Millennia has to place traps and activate them to prevent the intruders from conquering the castle. Unlike the first game, Kagero: Deception II is played from a third-person perspective. A major addition to the gameplay is the introduction of "trap combos": traps can be positioned in such a way that they will trigger each other, leading to powerful combinations that would harm the invaders more. The game also allows to customize traps and use various materials to build new ones. As before, the main character and her traps grow in power in correspondence with the amount of enemies killed, lending the game a RPG flavor.The morality system also present in this sequel, as the player can decide for Millennia whom to kill and whom to spare. Eventually, the player will be able to choose to join either the Timenoids or the humans.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Capcom Generation: Dai 3 Shū - Koko ni Rekishi Hajimaru</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-10-15</td><td>Capcom Co., Ltd.</td><td>Capcom Co., Ltd.</td><td>Compilation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The third release in the Capcom Generation series, featuring four early but unrelated Capcom games:Vulgus

The characters have the ability to jump, which must be used on several occasions to access specific locations. There are two types of combat in the game: standard and gear. In standard combat, the characters fight with equipped weapons, learning and performing different combos that can be executed in one turn. But often the heroes will have to explore dungeons while piloting giant robots called "gears". Gear combat follows different rules: they are able to perform actions until they run out of fuel, therefore the player must concentrate on finishing the enemy quickly. It is possible to equip various accessories on the gears, including those that will let them partially restore fuel. Gears cannot level up, but can be upgraded in workshops.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Dezaemon Kids!</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-10-22</td><td>Athena Co., Ltd.</td><td>Athena Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other), Side view, Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Shooter</td><td></td><td>Flight / aviation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Dezaemon Kids! is a title in the Dezaemon series that allows players to create their own shoot-'em-up games.

The gameplay is simple, walking around various dreamscapes and occasionally discovering surreal visuals. Coming into contact with any object or wall in the dream can result in warping to another part of a dream, which can go on for very long (up to 10 minutes), or can be cut short by falling off cliffs or through floors. After the dream ends, it is displayed on a graph showing whether it is considered Upper, Downer, Static or Dynamic.Gameplay takes place over various days, and after a long time passes, the counter resets, though the game can still be played. Textures can be completely randomized, and upon starting a new dream, you can not have the same one twice in a row, though dreams can be replayed using Flashback mode (unlocked after 20 days have passed), which is an option to revisit the same areas and allow you to choose different paths, though only for 3 to 5 minutes.There is no goal in the game, except to emulate dreams, ranging from colorful and happy, to dark and unsettling. Occasionally, dreams may be invaded by an apparition called the Grey Man, who can appear out of nowhere and remove your ability to remember a dream in Flashback mode.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Pop'n Pop</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-10-22</td><td>Taito Corporation</td><td>Dreams Co., Ltd., ITL Co., Ltd.</td><td>Puzzle</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Tile matching puzzle</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Real-time</td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Pop'n Pop is a puzzle game similar to Puzzle Bobble; the player's goal is to release colored bubbles from the bottom on the screen within a limited amount of time, trying to match three or more bubbles of the same color.

Take the original, Atari coin-op game Asteroids, add in the features of the Atari 2600 cartridge, then give it 3-D graphics and a bunch of power-ups, and you've got Activision's Asteroids remake.You are an employee of the Astro-Mining Corporation.  Your mission is to simply go to an assigned area of space and clear the area of asteroids and the occassional debris.  The game consists of five zones, each with a different background and some with special features.  Each zone has 15 levels.  In addition to the standard asteroids, there are also mined asteroids that explode; indestructible asteroids that are, well, indestructible; fireball comets; crystal asteroids that regenerate; alien egg asteroids containing deadly baby space worms; and ancient energy asteroids that shoot back!  And there's plenty of enemies in addition to the asteroids, such as Standard and Super Saucers, Asteroids Tugs, Fuel Transports, Hexes, Nuke Drivers, and Vulturoids.There are three types of ships to choose from, each with different strengths and weaknesses.  There are also three skill levels.  If you beat the game at Expert or higher, you gain access to a fourth type of ship.  All ships features the standard laser, shield, flip (instantly flips your ship 180 degrees), and hyperspace.  There are also limited power-ups you can  pick up such as GunSat, Mines, Homing Missiles, Plasma Drill, and Trigger Bombs.The game supports either one or two players.  In two player mode, the object is to simply outscore your opponent in a random zone and level.  You cannot directly kill your opponent by shooting him, but there are other ways....Lastly, if you shoot the classic-style asteroid in level 15 of the first zone, you'll find the option of "Classic Asteroids" now appearing on the main menu.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Brigandine: The Legend of Forsena</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-10-31</td><td>Atlus Software Inc.</td><td>Hearty Robin</td><td>Role-playing (RPG), Strategy</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td>Isometric</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Brigandine is a tactical role-playing game set in an active world where all of your army units and your enemy units fight and grow continuously.The story takes place on the continent of Forsena where a coup d'etat has taken place in the kingdom of Almekia. You have a choice of selecting one of five characters from surrounding kingdoms to conquer the kingdom of Almekia and return peace to Forsena once again. Gameplay is very much like other tactical games in that you first select the kingdom to attack, attack that country, organize your troops and repeat that process until victory. The gameplay is reminiscent of Ogre Battle in that when you invade a country you then select the towns or bases in which to attack to conquer that country. Your units will upgrade with experience from fighters to knights and barbarians to berserkers. Summon monsters like dragons and hydras to fight on your side which will grow with experience also. As with Final Fantasy Tactics, the Zodiac plays a role in determining every units effectiveness against another.  Elements (Fire, Nature, Water, Thunder) and Alignments (Neutral, Light, Dark) also figure into damage.The progression of a battle involves sending three Rune Knights and their retinue of monsters to represent your side.  Each Knight has a number of "rune points" calculated off of level, class, and particular attributes.  Each monster requires a number of rune points to have in the party, ranging from a ghoul (15) to a Lucifer (125).  Regardless of rune power a Knight can only have 6 units in his retinue.Each castle/fort/town produces a set number of 'Rune Energy', which is set against the 'upkeep' cost of all alive units.  In this way larger nations sustain more powerful fighters, smaller nations must sacrifice fighters who they can not upkeep, and saving up rune energy can allow a nation to quickly bolster forces after a defeat.The majority of the game takes place in 2D sprites except for the battle scenes which take place in full 3D polygons. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Bust-A-Move 4</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-10-31</td><td>Natsume, Inc.</td><td>Taito Corporation</td><td>Puzzle</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Tile matching puzzle</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Real-time</td><td>Everyone</td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Bust-A-Move 4 continues the gameplay tradition of the previous game in the series, focusing on releasing colored bubbles and matching them to make them disappear. This installment adds new characters to choose from, as well as a Story mode, where the player wins Tarot cards after each completed stage. In Story mode the player sees the story unfold as he defeats each CPU-controlled character (which change depending on the character the player starts with). The Win Contest mode is a simple "how many games can I win in a row" against the computer. Finally, should the player complete the Challenge mode (where he must complete certain puzzles as fast as possible, and get judged on technique, speed etc.), the Edit mode will become available, which allows players put together their own puzzles, completing with each other.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Rally Cross 2</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-10-31</td><td>Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc.</td><td>989 Studios, Idol Minds, LLC</td><td>Racing / Driving, Sports</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Off-roading</td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The sequel to the chaotic off-road rally racing game, Rally Cross.  The lead programmer, Mark Lyons, and the lead artist, Scott Atkins, from Rally Cross had left Sony and formed a new company, Idol Minds.  Rally Cross 2 was one of the first two games developed by Idol Minds. It was an attempt to build on the original, while creating a game with a simpler learning curve.  Rally Cross 2 retains the rough terrain of the original, with even more jumps and crashes. Multi-tap and 4 player split screen were not included in the sequel, but 2 player split screen remained. The ability to control attributes such as suspension, tires, and steering was added, as well as the ability to paint your car with a primary and detail color that can be picked from a large palette.Once again the courses can be raced forwards or backwards, and in suicide mode (cars racing in opposite directions at the same time). The multi-race season mode still exists. One of the biggest additions is the track editor. There are a dozen or so different pieces that can be rotated and dropped into a 2D grid to create completely new tracks.  The cars are still flipped upright with the shoulder buttons, but it now requires only a single button press instead of the multiple rocking motions in the original. Handling has changed significantly since cars tend to fishtail around the corners instead of flip, but high speed crashes will still result in an upside down car. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Rugrats: Search for Reptar</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-10-31</td><td>THQ Inc.</td><td>n-Space, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Puzzle elements</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Rugrats: Search for Reptar is a game for children in which you must help Tommy find pieces for his Reptar puzzle.

Its story takes place in the year 2198. Arcadia, a world far away from Earth, is under attack by aliens. As members of the Arcadia Defense Force, the player takes part in the fight against the invaders.Featuring 3D graphics, the game's perspective varies from side scrolling to top down. There are 4 weapons available to each character, though the differences are mostly cosmetic (a weak gun with wide spread, a stronger but slightly slower gun, a homing weapon, and a powerful BFG). As the character picks up a Gun item, the character's next tier gun slot is filled. Each gun can be upgraded three times, which increases the number of shots fired per trigger pull, but also increases energy drain. Energy can be recovered by picking up the appropriate item, as can health. It is also possible to store health or energy for later use (though each character has only one item slot). Other pick ups includes an invulnerable energy sphere (can't be stored), lighting barrier and bonus lives. Besides the usual movement and shooting, the characters can also aim up, down at various angles and have a 'strafe/ side step' move.There are seven action packed levels. Multiplayer is possible in two-player co-op mode.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Darkstalkers 3</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-11-01</td><td>Capcom Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Capcom Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td>Horror, Martial arts</td><td>Arcade, Fighting</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This is the 3rd in the Darkstalkers series.

This exit will then lead to a new small area of floating isles. In this game you can choose between a variety of playable characters, all of which have a different skill and style of movement.

Also Charlie will encounter bad guys along the way that he can take out with his "Egg Roll" and use his trusty wrench to trap and take out the baddies.There are 43 levels and 12 different bosses along with power-ups such as donuts that will increase Charlie's health.

But Rupture farms was just the beginning; the Glukkons are digging up bones at the ancient Mudokon burial grounds. They use the bones to make Soul Storm Brew. Abe must travel to the Soul Storm Brewery, stop those corporate villains and save the enslaved Mudokon workers.Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus is a 2D platform game very similar to its predecessor both visually and gameplay-wise. Like in the previous game, Abe has to outsmart his foes and avoid obstacles rather than confront them directly. The game is larger than its predecessor and is more oriented towards puzzle-solving, featuring more complex interaction with the Mudokons, who can now be angry, wired, depressed, sick, or blind. The first three problematic conditions can be removed with the appropriate "Gamespeak" command; sick Mudokons must be cured with a special item, while blind ones will follow Abe's voice and may fall to their deaths if Abe doesn't stop them in time.An additional ability Abe has is turning into a Mudokon deity called Shrykull, which possesses the power to instantly kill enemies. Transformation into Shrykull is possible only if Abe succeeds in sending several Mudokons through the bird portal at the same time. After having used Shrykull's power once, Abe transforms back into his normal Mudokon self. As opposed to the predecessor with its limited saving possibilities, a quick save feature has been added to Abe's Exoddus. The player can save at any time and resume playing from the same spot in case Abe dies.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Apocalypse</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-11-18</td><td>Activision, Inc.</td><td>Neversoft Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed, Regional differences</td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In Apocalypse, the player takes the role of Trey Kincaird, a nano-physicist with the look and voice of Bruce Willis.

While this is not the first Meitantei Conan game to be released, it is the first of many such adventure games on consoles. The game contains two original new cases which can be played in any order and contains anime style opening movies for each of the cases. The game uses top-down perspective with artwork showing side view to achieve bird's perspective presentation. In both episodes, the player directly controls Conan which can move up, down, left, or right, and can talk to other characters or interact with current locations and on-screen objects. As the case story progresses, many puzzle oriented mini-games will also become available.Doukyuusei Satsujin Jiken (同級生殺人事件) case

While they were investigating the case, an actual murder has occurred. A seemingly unrelated to the threatening letter schoolgirl has been killed. Conan isn't wasting a minute on letting Kogorou try and solve it and is already looking for clues, questioning suspects, and trying to make the deduction that will uncover the motive behind the murder and the real culprit responsible for it.Kotou no Takaramono Jiken (孤島の宝物事件) case
Boys detective club comprised of Conan Edogawa (whose real name is Shinichi Kudo), Ayumi Yoshida, Genta Kojima, and Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya, have come to visit Ayumi's uncle.

Scenario 2 focuses on Heiji Hattori, the great detective from the west who is also aware of Conan's true identity. And scenario 3 focuses on Conan Edogawa, whose real name is Shin'ichi Kudou. All three separate cases have one thing in common, though... the men in black organization who was behind Conan's mysterious transformation.

Included is the one that started it all, Street Fighter II: The World Warrior, and the two improved editions, Champion Edition and Hyper Fighting, known as Dash and Dash Turbo in Japan respectively.Street Fighter II: The World Warrior features all the basic features that would be carried over to subsequent Street Fighter II editions. The original game features eight selectable characters, with Ryu and Ken being the only characters with identical moves. In the single-player tournament, the player faces the other seven main characters, before proceeding to the final four opponents, which are non-selectable boss characters. Matches can go up to ten rounds if there is no clear winner before making the player lose by default (in Champion Edition and onward, this is reduced to four rounds).The most significant change to Street Fighter II: Champion Edition is the ability to play as the four boss characters, as well as allowing two players to select the same fighter, with one character being distinguished from the other with an alternate color scheme. Characters using their alternate color scheme have their names printed in blue below their lifebar. The number of opponents in the single-player mode is increased to twelve due to the addition of clone matches. Some of the artwork is redrawn as well and the stages' backgrounds are recolored. Much of the gameplay is revised to balance the characters out.Finally, Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting is a minor update released in response to the proliferation of modified bootlegs of Champion Edition. Released on December 1992 (eight months after Champion Edition), Hyper Fighting increases the game speed and adds new special techniques for some of the fighters such as Dhalsim's Yoga Teleport and Chun-Li's Kikoken. All of the characters receive new color schemes, with the new scheme becoming the default and the original color scheme as the alternate for all characters except M. Bison, who still uses his original color scheme as the default and the new scheme as the alternate.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Tomb Raider III: Adventures of Lara Croft</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-11-23</td><td>Eidos Interactive, Inc.</td><td>Core Design Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Behind view</td><td>Regional differences</td><td></td><td>Platform, Puzzle elements</td><td>Asia, Oceania</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The intrepid archaeologist Lara Croft ventures to India, searching for a legendary stone that once belonged to the tribe of Infada. Shortly after recovering the precious stone, she encounters a Dr. Willard, the head of an organization known as RX Tech. Willard is interested in an ancient Polynesian city built by people of a now defunct civilization, which worshipped a mysterious meteorite that hit the Earth millions of years ago. Willard tells Lara that the Infada Stone is in fact one of the four artifacts the ancient Polynesians fashioned from the material contained in the meteorite's core. Willard suggests Lara should look for the other three, scattered and hidden in various regions of the planet. It looks like another dangerous adventure awaits the fearless "tomb raider"!Tomb Raider III: Adventures of Lara Croft is an action game with platforming and  puzzle-solving elements. The gameplay system is similar to the one implemented in the previous game. Lara's abilities include running, jumping, climbing, swimming, rolling, crouching, crawling, sprinting, and swinging on bars and vines. A few new types of hazards have been added in this installment, including cold water in which Lara can swim for a limited amount of time, dangerous underwater creatures (such as piranhas), and the treacherous quicksand, which will swallow the heroine if the player isn't careful and fast enough to prevent her from falling into it.As in the previous game, Lara uses pistols, shotguns, harpoon guns, uzis, and grenade launchers to defend herself. New weapons include the Desert Eagle, MP5 sub-machine-gun, and rocket launcher. A few levels are designed in such a way that sneaking becomes the preferable solution, rather than directly engaging the enemies in combat. Unlike the previous games, the player can choose to tackle the levels in any order following the introductory Indian scenario.The player can save the game at any time in both the PC and the PlayStation versions; however, in the latter the amount of times the player can save the game depends on the amount of special crystals collected by Lara during her journey.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Knockout Kings</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-11-25</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>High Score Entertainment, Press Start Inc</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Thirty eight of the sport's greatest boxers (including Muhammad Ali, Evander Holyfield, Sugar Ray Leonard, Oscar De La Hoya & Lennox Lewis) are together for the first time in one game for you to compete as and against.Compete for a collection of different belts (lightweight, heavyweight, etc.) through-out the world as the greatest names in the history of boxing, or create your own boxer and go all the way to the top.Jimmy Lenno, Jr. adds his voice for ring announcements, Sean Ogrady and Al Albert commentate the play, and Mills Lane is your fighting instructor.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">1 on 1</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-11-26</td><td>Jorudan Co., Ltd.</td><td>Jorudan Co., Ltd.</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SMC, Kudō‑chō (工藤 長), Takeshi Nagata (永田 毅)</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">1 on 1 is, like the name suggests, a 1 on 1 basketball game played on half court with one basket only.

Not everyone will speak truthfully, and some will keep their secrets until you force them open, while others will be open and help you as best they can.

You are accompanied by Tsubasa Kataoka, one of the students, who also keeps info on all the suspects in her notebook, as well as other clues you uncover in your investigation.By questioning the suspects, new dialogues may reveal or you may acquire new items which can be checked more thoroughly in your inventory.

At any time during gameplay you can check your pocket watch to see how much time you are left with (you start at 11am and the train is to reach the destination at 1pm).

Yes, you've guessed it - the hero (and by extension, the player) can conquer the hearts of all three, plus a dozen more lovely girls that populate the city of Akitsuki - and that is pretty much what the story is about.First Kiss Story is what is commonly called a "visual novel", with even less interaction than a typical Japanese adventure with its menu-based commands. All the player can do here is to access locations from the town map, and sometimes choose a dialogue option. The locations with a "girl event" in them are marked with a heart on the map. Depending on the decisions taken by the player, the hero will end up with one of the pretty girls.

But no one can stop Mr. Domino - he has to run around everywhere, causing mayhem everywhere he goes.  Help Mr. Domino use the domino effect to trigger tricks and traps on unsuspecting objects and people!No One Can Stop Mr. Domino is a puzzle game which sees you controlling the titular Mr. Domino (or one of his friends, if you prefer) as he zips around levels which can be best described as a racetrack.  As the title suggests, you can't actually stop Mr. Domino - however, you can guide him around the track, speed him up and slow him down.  He'll need to dodge obstacles as he aims to activate "tricks" which are placed around the board.By holding down X, Circle, Triangle or Square as he runs, players can lay a trail of dominoes behind Mr. Domino.  When he reaches the dominoes you've placed, guide him into them to make them topple and start a chain reaction.  Make dominoes fall onto the "trick switches"  to activate them.  If you're clever, you can set off a chain reaction of dominoes by placing the next set of dominoes from the Hint Tile (a red circle) to the next trick switch, and so on, until all the level's tricks are completed.  As Mr. Domino runs, he loses stamina - lose all his stamina, and it's Game Over.  You can prevent this by running over Stamina Tiles, which replenish all his stamina.Mr. Domino can cause chaos in a variety of places - topple cards and shoot billiards at the casino; heat popcorn and crash toy cars in the supermarket; or crush a grandfather with a gigantic bell and indirectly cause a father to get punched in the genitals in the family home.

The objective of each level is to collect all of the keys scattered throughout to unlock the exit. The player can also collect coins and gems which increase their score.The direction of gravity relative to an object is always downward towards the surface which the object is rested on or the ball is jumping towards. When the ball reaches a point where the surface tilts upward or downward, such as the end of a pier or on a single block, the ball can move along this change in direction and relative gravity will shift accordingly, meaning that the beach ball is always on the surface facing up and objects do not fall from their positions on the other surfaces.There are also obstacles in many of the levels, such as spikes protruding from the floor, Captivators which move around a plane and capture the ball on contact, as well as ice blocks, which propel the ball forward uncontrollably, and blocks which collapse when the ball rolls over them to leave empty space where they stood. There is a fixed time limit which is constant across every level, which the player can reverse by collecting an hourglass. Red and yellow pills speed up the timer for a few seconds while slowing the balls movement, while blue and purple pills make the ball bounce uncontrollably and stop it from shifting gravity. The player can also fail a level by making the ball jump into empty space.In addition to coins and gems, each of the main levels contains a fruit, which changes depending on how many the player has collected. When the player collects five fruits, they are transported to a bonus level where ball must touch every block, their score only counting if they succeed. There also bonus levels in secret exits on some levels which function as normal levels but once again do not count a failed score.The single player portion of the game consists of Arcade mode, which involves racking up a high score and saving progress every 5 levels, and Time Trial mode, where the player must complete each level in a certain amount of time and save points come every 15 levels and there are no bonus levels. The player's score/time for a level is added to the total on completing the level, and taken away on failure. If the players score in Arcade mode falls below zero, or above zero in Time Trial, then they have to retry from their last save.The multiplayer modes consist of Copycat, where each player must copy exactly the other players movements and adding a new step each turn, and Time Trial, where the two players compete for faster completion times.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Uprising X</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-12-01</td><td>3DO Company, The</td><td>Cyclone Studios</td><td>Action, Strategy</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td>Tank</td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Uprising X is a PlayStation-exclusive entry in Cyclone Studios' series of tank simulators, combining the gameplay of real time strategy games with first-person combat.

The only way to stop this from happening is to collect 4 magic rings. Cue Nash, generic hero. Equipped with a sword and a limited amount of magic he sets out to slash, hack and slice his way to the 4 rings and in the end, a much nicer world to live in.The game plays much like Golden Axe but in full 3D, where Nash walks along a linear path and is constantly confronted by monsters who want nothing more than to end his life. Every now and then the player is given an opportunity to choose paths to get from point A to point B in several ways. At the end of every stage there is a boss waiting for Nash to make his day just a little less sunny and cheerful. In other words, they are usually evil and need plenty of killing.Nash has two standard attacks, one harder (but slower) and one weaker (but faster). Nash also has the ability to jump to cross broken bridges, cliffs and other natural hazards. A meter at the top of the screen fills up as Nash kills enemies and when it is full the player will be able to unleash a very powerful attack, which usually kills all the enemies on the screen.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Mizzurna Falls</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-12-23</td><td>Human Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Human Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td>Detective / mystery</td><td></td><td>North America</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This title is considered to be one of the first open world adventure games ever made.

Also, completing challenges may also earn the player new lures to use.The VS. mode lets from 2 to 4 players take turns fishing against each other. Players can choose how many casts are allowed (from 1 to 5 casts), how many games the competition will last (from 1 to 5 rounds), and what event to compete in (length, most weight, or number of fish caught).Once the player is ready to start fishing, they choose from a various amount of Megabass brand lures such as the Pop-X or V-Flat lures, to add to their tackle box.

All the Pac-Pellets, Ghosts, Walls, and Pac-Man are displayed in 3D.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Play with the Teletubbies</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999</td><td>Knowledge Adventure, Inc.</td><td>Asylum Entertainment Ltd.</td><td>Action, Puzzle</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Early Childhood</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Play with the Teletubbies is the first video game based on the popular kids TV series Teletubbies.

The detailed database is still there, and so are the Manager and Pro-Manager modes. Only the English leagues are playable still and Kevin Keegan, Fulham and then soon-to-be England manager, endorsed the title.The manager modes and options remain the same: Manager allows the player to start in any team, Pro-Manager requires building a career from the Conference, promoting the club from the lower divisions or getting promoted himself to better ranked teams. The difficulty level can be further tweaked by changing areas where the staff takes control, and you can determine if players age and retire with time.Again, up to 20 players can play in Manager mode and 8 in Pro-Manager.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Psychic Force 2012</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999</td><td>Taito Corporation</td><td>Taito Corporation</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td>Fighting</td><td>Cyberpunk / dark sci-fi</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Psychic Force 2012,  the sequel to Psychic Force,  is a one-on-one fighting game with a twist. The matches take place inside a giant floating cube. You are able to fly, using your psychic abilities, around a 3D arena with six walls. Each of the ten available characters, Might, Regina, Wendy, Emilio, Setsuna, Patty, Gudeath, Genshin, Carlo, and Gates, are controlled with three buttons: guard, weak attack and strong attack. The effect varies with the distance. Next to the regular life meter, there is also a power meter. By using special moves, the meter is drained and your moves are limited. It is possible to recharge, and the capacity of the power meter expands when you lose a lot of health.Additionally, each fighter has its own unique moves, energy attacks and a weapon, which they use, mid-flight, to pummel their opponent. There are three main game modes: training, versus and a story mode using static anime-inspired images and in-engine cut scenes to tell the story. The story centers around two groups of psychics with differing ideals about co-existence with humans. In the middle of this are several neutral psychics with ties to members in either group.The later PlayStation port, renamed to Psychic Force 2, adds the 3 missing characters from the first game (Genma, Brad and Sonia), the psy-expand mode where the player can play a series of special battles to learn other character attacks, and an anime intro video replacing the original in-game intro. It also lowers the overall difficulty of the CPU fighters and makes some control adjustments (for instance the shield can now optionally be enabled with a single button). Of course, the graphics were notably degraded.

The midwestern town of Raccoon City is in ruins, having been overrun with the undead creating T-virus thanks to the wacky hijinks of William Birkin and Umbrella Inc. The player must guide Jill "master of unlocking" Valentine (one of the two main protagonists of the original Resident Evil) out of the city alive. Along the way, Jill will interact with and receive help from (or be hindered by) three Umbrella mercenaries who are also stranded in Raccoon City. Standing in the way of your group's last escape are a horde of flesh-eating zombified citizens, homicidal mutants, and a relentless killing machine known only as Nemesis who is determined to hunt down and kill the survivors of the original Resident Evil, including Jill.A dramatic improvement over Tyrant/Mr. X/G from the previous games, Nemesis can run (faster than Jill, in fact), use firearms (a rocket launcher), dodge attacks, and even move through doors and from room to room in pursuit of Jill. On top of that he still possesses the nigh indestructibility we've come to know from Umbrella's ultimate bio-weapons. Like its two predecessors Resident Evil 3 is a third-person action-adventure game with polygonal characters on pre-rendered backgrounds with cinematic camera angles, a technique originally pioneered by Alone in the Dark. Although the game uses the same basic engine and gameplay as the previous games, the gameplay is improved by features such as auto-targeting, a 180 degree spin, and a new dodge move that allows Jill to avoid enemy attacks. Another addition is Jill's ability to create different kinds of ammunition by mixing together three different types of gunpowder found throughout the game. The game include a randomization feature, which changes the location of certain key items and ammo. Another noteworthy feature is that at certain points in the game, Jill is faced with two choices for a situation, each will affect later story, and even the game ending. The zombies have also been made more diverse.The number of polygons in the character models has also been increased, along with the possible screen resolution and color depth for the PC version (up to 1600 X 1200 at 32 bits, from a maximum of 640 X 480 at 16 bits for Resident Evil 2). Another addition in the PC version is the ability to skip cutscenes as well as the door loading animation.The PC and Dreamcast versions includes all eight of Jill's possible costumes, as well as the mercenary mini-game Operation Mad Jackal which allows you to play as one of the three Umbrella soldiers. On the Playstation version, these special features must be unlocked by beating the game with a high score.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Rugrats: Studio Tour</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999</td><td>THQ Inc.</td><td>n-Space, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Rugrats: Studio Tour is an action game based on the Daytime Emmy-award winning animated television series Rugrats.The Rugrats have lost Dil Pickles.

The bottom of the screen shows how many numbers there are left to be found. At the courtyard addition is practised by picking up and throwing the requirement number of balls to solve exercises.

On his journey he meets the beautiful elven girl Windleaf and the robot Harv-5, who help him to reach his ultimate goal.Although it all seems like a typical Japanese RPG, it is not. Shadow Madness was developed and produced in the USA, although, beyond any doubt, the Final Fantasy series has been the main source of inspiration here.

Effectively a merger between Rage software's Striker franchise and playstation/dreamcast evolution with Infogrames' UEFA license. UEFA Striker offered a mix of arcade and simulation style gameplay and a certification mode, where the player was tested for skills in order to unlock game modes.The game featured many clubs from around the world in some form or another, but in it's primary game tournament mode was focused around European clubs.In addition to simple and quick selection of a 'friendly match' the game supported the following tournaments:Super Trophy - Featuring up to 32 teams drawn from a pool of over 40 of the most popular European teams.  In round 1 the 32 teams start off in four leagues, each playing the other teams within the league twice.  The top two teams from each league proceed to round two, similar to round one yet with two leagues of four teams.  The top two teams play the final, a tie resolved with extra time and then penalties.National Team Qualifiers - a mode only unlocked when you reached 3/10 in certification tests.  Belgium and Holland were not included in the list of 49 teams split into 9 groups in a pre-defined way.  This was likely because the mode was designed to mirror the Euro 2000 competition, for which Infogrames did not own the license and so could not use the official name (the tournament was based in Holland/Belgium and they automatically qualified as a result).  The player could choose to player any one of those 49 teams, one home and one away match against the other teams in the same group...the top team going to the finals.  Group ties resolve by goal difference, scored then conceded.  The best of out of all those teams which placed second in the groups also goes forward.  The remaining eight second place enter a single knockout round, with four going through to the finals.National Team Finals - Must have certified 3/10 and succeeded in the National Team Qualifiers.  The remaining 16 teams from the qualifiers (or a new selection), including Belgium and Holland are split into four groups of four, playing each group member once.  The top two teams proceed to a knockout format - Quarters, Semis and Finals.  Penalty shootouts settle ties.Territories Cup - Certified 5/10 unlocks this mode, basically league play around various world locations - completion of each cup unlocks the next territory.8/10 in certification mode unlocked a bonus competition.  The game also supported generic league and knockout tournament play, as well a classic matches - four preconfigured scenarios replaying historical matches.English live commentary was from Ron Atkinson and Jonathan Pearce.

With only two survivors, team members Alex and Michelle, it's up to them to take out the threat themselves.Gameplay resembles the early Resident Evil games, with its 3D characters over fixed pre-rendered backdrops and combination of puzzle solving and action elements. One big difference, however, is the ability to switch between any of the characters at any given time. This feature is used to solve certain puzzles and to find different routes through the Togusa building. Throughout the game you will acquire four different allies to aid you. You never find new weapons in the game, so you need to use the characters wisely and where needed, since they all have different abilities and arms. You can also split them up in teams of two, to make things more versatile.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">TNN Motorsports Hardcore TR</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999</td><td>American Softworks Corporation</td><td>Eutechnyx Limited</td><td>Racing / Driving, Sports</td><td>Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Off-roading</td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Steam Store Description (from Ad Blurbs)Time to hop into a dirt-thumping dune buggy or tricked-out truck and race your way to victory in TNN MOTORSPORTS HARDCORE HEAT.

In 2089, an invading Xenon empire destroys several lunar outposts. The base Nectaris, the largest of the lunar outposts wasn't fully destroyed and a few units escaped alive and now are planning a counter attack on the Xenon empire. Now it's up to the player who is put into the role as the Union forces commander to defeat the enemy Xenon forces. The main campaign goes through a series of over 30 different battlefields. Gameplay involves moving various units on an overhead map of the battlefield. Units movement are done on hexagonal grids. Once the players units make their moves, it is then their opponents turn to move their units. Players can use their various units to attack the opposing forces. Battles sequences are turn based. The outcome of a battle can be affected by the terrain, any support fire present, an encirclement effect, plus the individual strengths and weaknesses of the unit types that are involved in the skirmish. Since both the player and the enemy forces have access to the same unit types, the game emphasizes knowing each units strengths and weaknesses, and the strategic placement of units.

You must locate cities so as to make use of food, construction and trade resources, which can be later improved by constructing irrigation, roads, mines, railroads, and farmland. Each city can construct one item at a time - civilian and military units, buildings or Wonders of the World (there are 28 of these across the different eras of the game, and each can be possessed by only one city). The buildings and wonders have different effects - most buildings and some wonders improve defenses, scientific research, trade or food output, but most wonders offer unique advantages that can be used to great strategic effect.There are over 100 scientific advancements in the game, and most require prerequisites before they can be researched. How quickly this happens depends on your scientific output, which must be traded off against financial and military concerns.Combat can occur in cities or in the open terrain - things like forests and mountains give the defense an advantage. Unlike in the original Civilization, fights aren't always won outright - most times the winning unit will be damaged, reducing its movement speed and attacking prowess until it's repaired, but the losing unit always disappears from game. If multiple units are in a square that come sunder attack, the strongest unit fights - unless it is a city or Fortress, all units will be lost if the fight is lost. Once a city has no defensive units left, it can be captured. Certain units have the ability to cover all squares as fast as if they were roads, only a few can see submarines, and air units require re-fueling in a friendly city.There are up to 6 other Civilizations in the game, and keeping good diplomatic relations with these is crucial. At times you may want to trade knowledge or pool military resources with a neighbor - at others they may want to destroy you. If you make deals and go back on them your reputation is affected.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Egypt 1156 B.C.: Tomb of the Pharaoh</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-01-05</td><td>Canal+Multimédia, Cryo Interactive Entertainment, Réunion des Musées Nationaux</td><td>Cryo Interactive Entertainment</td><td>Adventure, Educational</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td>Detective / mystery</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">A number of games allow you to search the tombs of ancient Egypt, but few allow you to do so IN ancient Egypt.

You have three days to prove his innocence and stay the sentence of execution.Gameplay takes place in a first person mode similar to fans of this kind of adventure game. Unlike some games that give you a static, unmoving image to look at, Egypt 1156 B.C. allows you to look around at any location in a smooth turn (similar to QuickTime VR, but with better results). This gives you a 'you are there' feel that many other games lack. All graphics are 3-D rendered and occassionally actions will give you a third person cutscene as a reward. Communication is through a simple branch tree and both talking and puzzle solving involves the manipulation of objects, both in and out of your inventory. In addition to being a mystery/adventure game, Egypt 1156 B.C. also comes with reference material about ancient Egypt, its people, and its culture.

The eight protagonists are: Keima Amemiya, a policeman; Jintaro Umabe, an actor; Masami Ushio, a gang member; Yoshiko Hosoi, without a particular profession (the only female protagonist in the game); Masashi Shinoda, a student; Ryuji Takamine, a deserter; Fumiyasu Ichikawa, a writer; and Yohei Tobisawa, a high-school boy. You control the characters by making decisions for them: where to go next, how to answer to another character, etc. In many cases, there are wrong decisions which lead to a premature end (bad ending). The story is presented through text (without voices) and still shots of live actors and locations, with occasional short animated sequences. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Refrain Love 2</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-01-28</td><td>Riverhillsoft Inc.</td><td>Riverhillsoft Inc.</td><td>Adventure</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td>Romance</td><td>Japanese-style adventure, Visual novel</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Refrain Love 2 is a sequel to Refrain Love: Anata ni Aitai and while there are some differences in gameplay, and this sequel features new protagonist, the premise is somewhat similar since it is also romantic visual novel adventure game focused on meeting and dating various girls.

Shortly afterwards, Knight has a vision: a mysterious voice tell him that they should go to a place called "God's Tower", where they can find Baby's mother. On their way, the three encounter people and groups with different agendas, and eventually begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together and discover the source of evil.Guardian's Crusade - or Knight & Baby, as it was originally called - is a Japanese-style role-playing game with turn-based combat.  A notable feature of the game is a seamless 3D world, without the transitions from "world map" to individual locations or hostile areas to towns, as it is the case in most comparable games. The game has no random battles: all the enemies are visible during exploration, and can be avoided or bypassed silently. Lower-level enemies will flee when they see the protagonist's party. During his journey, Knight will find so-called Living Toys, mechanical creatures that can assist him in battles. There are many types of Living Toys - offensive, supportive, healing, and those that can be used outside of combat.

The background story involves a battle between seven legendary warriors, led by the young magician Ten, against an evil dragon. The player assumes the role of a nameless adventurer, male or female, who ventures to the city of Farbell. There, he or she is instructed to join the the Adventurers Guild, and eventually becomes involved in the grand struggle against dark forces threatening Estleia.In the beginning of the game the player has to create a customized character, modifying his or her age, hair color, clothes, height, and weight. Character class can not be assigned, but the player character can eventually specialize as either a monk, a magician, or a thief, by completing missions for the respective guilds. The protagonist has three main attributes - spirit, technique, and vitality, which can be manually increased whenever he or she levels up. Other attributes include various aspects of physical preparation and conditions, which act as requirements for equipping weapons and armor. Experience points in the game are awarded for defeating enemies as well as for completing quests.Despite its Japanese origins, Weltorv Estleia is a free-form RPG that is closer to Western templates. The game's world consists of interconnected areas and contains several towns, wilderness areas, and dungeons. The player is free to explore the game world and undertake any quests from the onset. The game's scenario system allows players to pursue as many quests as they wish at the same time. By interacting with the various non-player characters, the player gets key words or key phrases indicating details and giving clues about the currently selected active scenario. The scenarios will then trigger when the player, having followed the clues, reaches the scenario point. By fulfilling the requirements for each scenario, the player progresses through the game. There are over a hundred scenarios, ranging in length and difficulty, sometimes having different possible outcomes.Interaction with NPCs also allows the player to express emotions by having the player character smile, cry, or become angry. These emotional responses during conversations may influence the way NPCs react to the hero. The player can also have the main character draw his weapon at any time. Combat in the game is turn-based. Battles are fairly sporadic and occur either in a scripted manner, dictated by the scenario, or by approaching hostile creatures that may be encountered in the wilderness. The player navigates the main character on the battle screen in a tactical fashion, attacking enemies when they are within the range of the equipped weapon. Over the course of the game, several characters may join the hero's party, usually as a possible scenario outcome. These characters are controlled by the AI during combat.The game's outdoor areas (including towns), dungeons, as well as all the characters and enemies, are rendered in 3D. Only smaller indoor locations such as shops, guilds, bars, people's houses, etc., are presented as pre-rendered backgrounds. There are no character portraits and the game generally eschews anime-style aesthetics usually associated with RPGs of Japanese origin.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">pop'n music</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-02-25</td><td>Konami Co., Ltd.</td><td>Konami Computer Entertainment Studios Yokohama</td><td>Action</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Music / rhythm</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">pop'n music is the first title in Konami's long-running rhythm game series, and the second Bemani series after the original beatmania.

If the groove meter is high enough at the end of the song, the player can move on to the next song.This first release includes all of the music from the original arcade release, along with several new original tracks.

The trademark Hot Pursuit mode game mode from the first game in the series is still present, where players race opponents on tracks filled with regular traffic and police cars that chase the racers. The classic pursuit mode is extended with two additional modes: Getaway and Time Trap. In Getaway the player needs to shake off the police in a set amount of time, or playing as the police trap a speeder before time runs out. In Time Trap an entire race needs to be completed before time runs out, or as the police all speeders need to be arrested. There are minor differences between the two platforms for this game mode, regarding spike strips, road blocks, and back-up. The latter for instance is unique to the PlayStation version. The Pursuit mode is available in multiplayer as well and players can take different sides or race together.It is the first game in the series to introduce a Career mode with a set of challenges. Beating these is rewarded with trophies for unlocks, and money to spend on new cars, repairs and upgrades. In the PlayStation version the Career mode is split up into two different sets of challenges: Tournament (required races) and Special Event (optional races). High Stakes in the title refers to races where players bet their cars. In the PC version these are a part of the Career mode when the player owns more than two cars. In the PlayStation version two players can insert their memory cards and race against each other. The winner immediately receives the opponent's car and it is deleted from the loser's memory card right away.In addition to the new game modes it is also the first game in the series to have a detailed physics models. Damage now affects both the appearance and the performance of the car for the first time.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Retro Force</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-03-01</td><td>Psygnosis Limited</td><td>Psygnosis Limited</td><td>Action</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Shooter</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">3D scrolling shoot-em-up.

Magical pieces consists of more than four blocks and are thus harder to place, but can theoretically clear more lines at once. Magical attacks can be countered by clearing lines while the piece is in the queue. This sends the piece back to the opponent, changing it to a 2x2 square piece. Countered pieces can again be countered, growing in size with each counter to a maximum of 5x5. Overflow to an already full queue turns existing pieces into ones marked with an exclamation mark. These can't be countered and are massive in size and come in pyramid or diamond shapes. A clock counts the time during Magical Tetris - each minute of game time raises the game level, up to a maximum of 4, with higher levels resulting in more magical pieces added to the opponent's queue per cleared line.Updown Tetris is less complex. Attacks against the opponent are made by clearing two or more lines, which are then (minus one column) added to the bottom of the opponent's playing field, pushing their stack higher.Both modes include another gameplay element: the magical gauge is filled by clearing single lines or through attacks made by the opponent. Filling the meter clears the entire playing field above a certain threshold and simplifies the block structure below it. The meter is then cleared and the threshold rises, requiring more moves to fill it a second time. The threshold can only be lowered by clearing all blocks off the field.The two modes are available in story and two-player modes. In story mode, players select one of four Disney characters (Mickey, Donald, Goofy and Minnie) who each come with their own storylines. The game then consists of consecutive matches against the other characters and the bad guys (Pete, Big Bad Wolf and Weasel), with cutscenes between matches.Only the home versions have an endless mode, which offers standard Tetris and Magical Tetris.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Million Classic</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-03-18</td><td>Bandai Co., Ltd.</td><td></td><td>Simulation, Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td>Managerial / business simulation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Million Classic (ミリオンクラシック) is a simulation game which focuses on breeding and creating the ultimate racing horses.

People remember it as one of the most horrible tragedies in history. Since the War of the Magi, magic has been all but forgotten, technology began to grow, and people returned to seemingly normal lives. The only true worry people have is the Empire, whose leaders are looking to revive the great force once known as "magic". The Empire had heard word of the remains of a mystical being, known as "Esper", being found in the mining town of Narshe. Quickly, three soldiers were dispatched to find this Esper and bring it to the Emperor. One of the soldiers, a young girl, triggers a power in the Esper that initiates a dangerous series of events. The only ones who can help her are a rag-tag band of rebels and heroes, who offer their very hearts and souls to save the world from the mad plans of the Empire.The sixth entry in the Final Fantasy series was dubbed Final Fantasy III in the West because three out of the five previous installments of the series had not been released there at the time. Similar to its predecessors, this is a role-playing game where the player controls a party of characters, traveling between various locales in the world, fighting randomly appearing regular enemies and bosses, and making the characters stronger by improving their skills and getting better equipment for them. The game maintains the ATB (active time battle) system of the two previous installments in the series, spicing traditional turn-based combat engine with a real-time element. In battle, every character can fight using weaponry and items, and each has a special combat skill as well. It is also possible for nearly every character to learn magic spells. By finding various Espers and equipping them on characters, the player can improve their parameters in different ways and choose the magic spells the characters should learn.Unlike most other Japanese RPGs, the game does not have a single main character. Rather, the player-controlled party can be considered the game's collective protagonist. The first part of the game develops linearly, with one of the characters playing a central role; however, during the second part, the player is associated with a different character initially, exploring the game world, recruiting characters, and completing sub-quests in a non-linear fashion.PlayStation re-release of the game includes new FMV cutscenes, bestiary, and artwork galleries. Game Boy Advance version and later Android, iOS, and PC releases remove FMVs but instead include two new bonus dungeons (the Dragons' Den and the Soul Shrine), new bosses, espers, weapons, and gear, as well as many other minor additions and changes.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Puzzle Mania 2</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-03-25</td><td>HAMSTER Corporation</td><td>Human Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Puzzle</td><td>Text-based / Spreadsheet, Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Word construction</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">PlayStation Store Description (from Ad Blurbs)To download content to the Memory Stick PRO Duo™ of your PSP® (PlayStation®Portable) system, the free space required is twice the size of the content to be downloaded.This software is playable for PLAYSTATION®3 and PSP® (PlayStation®Portable).To play this software on your PLAYSTATION®3 system, you must have at least 10MB of free space on your PLAYSTATION®3 system hard disk.To play this software on your PSP®, you must install the latest system software version and have a Memory Stick Duo™ with the free space stated above.For more detailed information about downloading to your PSP® system, please see URL below.http://asia.playstation.comWhen downloading using PC:When downloading contents to PSP®, you must install the PLAYSTATION®Network Downloader application first.

Most of the characters from the past four years return, thus providing the player with a very large roster containing 38 characters. Many of the characters have been altered in an attempt to make the game balanced regardless of the player's choice of fighter. Rugal Bernstein is provided as a non-secret character for the first time in KOF '98, and several regular characters have hidden "alternate" versions that may also be used in-game. KOF '98 uses the same gameplay system present in The King of Fighters '97, so players may still choose between Extra and Advanced modes.

Like to work with exotic animals? Like helping people? Then start gathering your seeds today!Monster Seed obviously takes influence from the popular animal raising/fighting genre; specifically games like Pokémon and Monster Rancher. Of course, it does do a few things differently. One major difference is the fantasy setting. No ranches or medical settings here, no sir. Another key difference is in the overall presentation; Monster Seed's gameplay and interface are a lot more simple than most other breeding games.Similar to mother games in the genre, there's a brief tutorial of sorts, and then you're off to gather your own creatures, earning better seeds and other breeding components as you go. Just be careful with your critters, because if they die in battle, they're gone for good. Granted you can always breed more, but it can certainly set you back if your creature hatches at level five, but you lost a level twelve.Combat itself uses a somewhat typical turn-based system, with a grid used to determine character locations, spell ranges and so on. Much like a normal RPG, you get to take turns giving commands to your main character and your monsters. Different monsters are better suited for different roles, with some better off hanging out in the back, attacking from a distance and others in the front lines, absorbing the damage and dishing out the hurt.Monster Seed isn't the most innovative RPG/breeding game out there, but it is a decent game that will help any fan of the genre pass the time.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-04-01</td><td>KID Corp.</td><td>Tactics</td><td>Adventure</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td>Adult</td><td>Visual novel</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Narrative</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Kohei Orihara is a Japanese high school who has experienced much tragedy in his life. When he was a child, both his parents died. After he lost his little sister, Kohei became increasingly reclusive, and eventually creates an alternate reality for himself, called "Eternal World". This world resembles afterlife, though it is possible to return from it to the real world under certain circumstances. As Kohei forms relationships with the game's female characters, they begin to forget him after a while, which causes him to retreat deeper into the Eternal World. Only by creating a strong bond with one of these girls can Kohei return to real life.One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e is a visual novel. The player reads text descriptions and dialogues, which are superimposed on still 2D anime-style images that represent locations and events. The interaction is reduced to occasional moments when the player is prompted to make a choice for the protagonist, splitting the storyline into different branches, and eventually reaching one of the several different endings.The initial PC release has scened with explicit adult content. These were removed in the subsequent console version, which also added voice acting for the game's characters.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e (Shokai Genteiban)</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-04-01</td><td>KID Corp.</td><td>Tactics</td><td>Adventure</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td>Visual novel</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Buy at Buy at </td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The first print limited edition of One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e includes:

The ideals and attitudes many a harried housewife of the 1950's had against rock'n'roll has come back, albeit more aggressive than ever. The authorities, in fact, have taken it upon themselves to ban rock'n'roll and all that it stands for. However, one band in particular apparently didn't get the memo - the Japanese group "R", who have come to America to perform in Los Angeles. Now "R" must outrun - and snowboard their way - past the authorities in order to avoid heading to the slammer.R: Rock'n Riders otherwise known as simply R is a snowboard simulation game in which four of the six members of the rock band "R" must board their way across the Western United States in order to make it to their gig in Los Angeles. To complete a stage successfully, the player must collect five indicators and make it to the end before time expires. To do this, the player must perform different types of tricks, grab (and attempt to hold on to) musical instruments, and avoid getting hit or falling down in order to score points. Scoring points also improves the quality of the in-game music, which begins each stage in an incomplete and virtually non-existent state.After each stage (except the fourth and final) is complete, the player can view a replay accompanied by music.In addition, players can access the "Music room" to see the characters playing their instrument, and after they complete the game with all four playable characters, they can access the "Extra Game", in which the band members must battle seven opponents - not just with their speed, but with their punching skills.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Rock'n Riders (Limited Edition)</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-04-01</td><td>Fab Communications Co., Ltd.</td><td></td><td>Special edition</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This limited edition contains:

In this huge city, each house has a computer, and all computers are linked to one big network. The flow of information is being controlled by the government, and software companies create huge virtual locations-networks. An eighteen-year-old member of a hacker group called Spookies and his companions gain access to one of these networks - a virtual city called Paradigm-X, created by Algon Soft. However, an accident occurs during the hacking, and a mysterious demon who calls herself Nemissa emerges. The Spookies must find the true reason behind Nemissa's arrival, and confront a shadowy organization known as Phantom Society, which employs demon summoners.Soul Hackers is similar in its themes, structure and gameplay to its predecessor, as well as to the main Shin Megami Tensei series. Set in a futuristic cyberpunk environment, the game contains many characteristic elements such as two weapon types (swords and guns) for the main hero, a female companion who can learn and cast magic spells, and a party of six active combatants, of which four are demons. Like in many other Megami Tensei games, the player can communicate with randomly encountered demons and recruit them into the party by selecting appropriate dialogue choices. These demons can also be fused with each other to create more powerful ones.The loyalty system from the previous game returns; however, this installment makes it easier to raise the loyalty level of a demon. By taking a demon into battles and repeatedly performing action it likes (indicated by its comments to the player's choices), the player can gradually make it fully controllable and obedient. Attack and magic power of the demons raises together with their loyalty levels.New in this installment is a limited ability to fuse demons outside of specific fusion places, by using the protagonist's demon-summoning computer (COMP). The player can also purchase and install software on this computer, which has a variety of functions, from combat-aiding and mapping utilities to the possibility to save the game anywhere in the dungeon.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Kotobuki Grand Prix</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-04-08</td><td>Syscom Entertainment Inc.</td><td>Syscom Entertainment Inc.</td><td>Racing / Driving</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Bike / Bicycling</td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Back of Jewel Case - PlayStation (UK) (from Ad Blurbs)Choose from one of eight characters, each with their own unique bike and riding style, in this crazy race where anything goes!

Gameplay mechanics are the same of Super Robot Wars 4 (and Super Robot Wars F, of course). It's a turn strategy game, when attacked the player can decide to counter, to dodge (halves the % of being hit) and to defend (it halves the damage eventually received).

While racing, player are allowed to hit their opponents in order to get an advantage in the race.The game features 13 different racers to use. Each racer has their own strength,stamina,freestyle,quickness, and agility ratings. Each racer also only specializes in one type of equipment to race with.

Focused on a fictional North American league, with GHL (Gremlin Hockey League) club teams, the game enhances the graphics and gameplay of the previous version. While the game is unlicensed, all teams were inspired by their real NHL counterparts, from team logos to player names (using the classic trick of changing one letter from the name to other phonetically close). Features include three speeds of play, a three-on-three arcade mode with smaller ring, network play and advanced body collision physics. Like NHL Championship (released around the same time), the game adds a coloured track to the puck named "GremTrax". Slower shots and passes are coloured green, and faster red (opposite to the blue/red combination used by Fox). Tactics were not forgotten, and the player is able to select the lines, select how and how fast teams build up the attack and are expected to shoot on goal and how to defend. If the player does not feel like controlling everything, tactical decisions can be left to the computer. It's also possible to trade players to balance or keep rosters up to date.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Sports Car GT</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-04-23</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Image Space Inc.</td><td>Racing / Driving</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Automobile, Track racing</td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Sports Car GT racing at it's best.

The field is small, surrounded by a hip-height that board players can use to bounce the ball. The rules are simple: the game starts like in basketball, with the ball being dropped between the two forwards in midfield. The rest of the game is very freeform, with fouls being awarded for awkward challenges (penalties are given if the attacking player is on the break) and throw-ins (scored with the feet) if the ball goes above the boards. The player can select the tactics - with the three field players (the goalkeeper can't leave the goal area), it's possible to play more offensively (with two in front and one in the back) or defensively (two in the back and one in front). While the real tournament was traditionally played on public parks and car lots, the game version includes these and more exotic settings, such as an airport, a ship's deck, or in the middle of a city crossroad. The grand finals are always played inside an indoor arena.After a team manages a number of shots, they are entitled to three "supershots", which are much more powerful and swerve a lot more than regular shots. The three shots, if well used, can turn a game upside down in a matter of seconds, or mean the team will have to do a lot to make up for them if spoiled. While building up the Supershot gauge, the player has to rely on well-placed shots, headers, volleys, bicycle kicks, or moving the ball in attack very quickly to score. By winning competitions, players can unlock Puma-sponsored stars, such as JJ Okocha, Lothar Matthaus, Angelo Peruzzi, or Gianluca Pagliuca, and compete with them in their national teams.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Street Fighter Alpha 3</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-05-01</td><td>Capcom Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Capcom Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Fighting</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Street Fighter Alpha 3, the third game in the Alpha series, has a total of 31 fighters, the most in the series so far.

World Tour - Simply choose your fighter and travel around the world, fighting the hometown heroes that you run into. The more fights you win, the stronger your fighter becomes. You can also learn new moves, and there are three levels of Super moves to choose from before you start each round (called Isms).Arcade - A simple conversion of the arcade version. Beat each fighter with your chosen warrior, in three rounds per match (much the same as past versions of Street Fighter)Versus - Two human players battle it out. Training - A good way to learn all the super moves that are available, against a dummy.Entry - If you save your character during the World Tour mode, you can upload him here to use in the other modes in the game (especially handy for Training).Finally, if you complete certain areas of the game three new fighters become available, including another old favorite in Guile, Evil Ryu, and Shin Akuma.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Dragon Money</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-05-04</td><td>Micro Cabin Corp.</td><td>E.O.

In this version, Cloud, Tifa, Yuffie, Vincent, Zack, Red XIII & Sephiroth from  Final Fantasy VII join the many characters from the arcade version released in Japan. Comprised of the main arcade mode, mini-game mode, and an all new RPG mode known as "Brand New Quest". The mini-game mode contains four games: - Battle Beach, a triathlon of button mashing. - Battle Square, tackle-Othello on a disco floor - Infinity Battle, an endurance test with unlimited lives. - And a foot racing game using the fighting game controls. The main game mode is an arcade-style fighting game.  Charismatic fighters from around the world compete in a tournament for a mysterious sword as the prize.  In addition to your archetypes of kick boxers, wrestlers, and mixed martial artists there are also animal type fighters, homing missiles, characters with swords, and many other attacks that shake things up. The fighting system is based on attack height (much like Bushido Blade) - with the triangle, square, and x buttons corresponding to high, mid, and low attacks respectively.  There are also different buttons for low and high guard - both working against mid-level attacks but specific to high and low attacks.  The circle button is used for 'special' attacks, which drain the 'special' bar.  There is a button to jump, as well as a button that changes between 'locking' on the target to move or free running. The standard balance in fighting games is speed vs. damage.  Whether it be ranged or melee attacks, the 'damage per second' should be the same - as every character has an equal health bar.  Ehrgeiz is a very balanced game, despite the complexity presented by how fundamentally different most characters are. The vast differences between certain characters require the player to devise separate strategies for different opponents. The animal type opponents, for example, can only be hit with roughly half the attacks of the normal opponents - head kicks, many long range attacks, and most throws will hit empty air, especially since animal characters can 'duck' even lower to the ground. Fighting a gun wielding character will result in a battle where you must chase and pin down. Fighting Cloud or Sephiroth will require both constant pressure and vigilance against being thrown to ensure that they are not able to unsheathe their sword and finish the fight in a few blows.  The game features unlock-able costumes and characters, as well as 'ending videos'. The "Brand New Quest" feature is a dungeon delver that uses the fighting game engine along with randomly generated dungeon layouts to create a 25 level dungeon with set bosses.  It borrows the magic and equipment system from the Final Fantasy games, you will collect materia and magic stones, as well as a full range of visibly different weapons and armour.  This game puts strong emphasis on food (like the early Ultima series).  Not only will you have to eat, but you will have to be conscious of what you are eating - your diet affects how your stats change at level up.  Eat meat for strength, minerals for dexterity, carbs for speed, lipids for defence, and vitamins for magical ability.  Standing still allows your depleting 'stomach' meter to fill your health.  If your hunger meter reaches 'zero', however, it will start draining your health.   There are two playable characters, and the game can be played with both characters or with only one.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Pocket Dungeon</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-05-04</td><td>Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.</td><td>Liquid</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Pocket Dungeon is a dungeon crawling role-playing game which is played entirely on PocketStation, Sony’s PDA crossed with a memory card.

By scraping through the first two heats (the Final GP accepts nothing but a victory), sponsors will be unwilling to invest in the team and instead of a new car, the mechanics will only upgrade the current vehicle. But winning all races allows the driver to reach the Shooting Hoops speedway with the fastest car. By combining all qualifying placements, 320 cars are waiting to be unlocked.R4 Ridge Racer Type 4 also includes an extra disk, featuring the original Ridge Racer in higher resolution.

The curse is placed by a mysterious person who calls himself the Joker. Rumors say that he can fulfill people's wishes, but also does something horrible to those who for some reason fail to express a wish. A group of high school students decides to investigate the matter. However, when they confront the Joker, he tells them that they have hurt him in the past, and that he is out for revenge now. The young people realize that the Joker's appearance is just the beginning of a sinister chain of events, and will have to look for answers within their own souls.Persona 2: Innocent Sin is similar in structure and basic gameplay to its predecessor. Much of the game consists of navigating a party of up to five active combatants through locations in the large city, exploring complex dungeons, and fighting randomly appearing demons in round-based style. Unlike the first game, dungeons are viewed from an angled overhead perspective with rotatable camera. Rather than having the option of using either a melee weapon or a gun, each character is equipped with his or her own specific weapon.Like in the previous game, communication with demons plays a significant role. The demon conversation system has been refined: it is now possible to choose more specific and accurate dialogue lines, and the effects of the player's responses are less random. Tarot cards of a specific Persona type are collected from the demons following a successful conversation. They can be later used in a special location called Velvet Room to acquire new Personae, which can be equipped on playable characters, enhancing their parameters and teaching them different spells and abilities. In the beginning each Persona is only capable of a basic ability; new ones are gradually learned by repeatedly using the powers of said Persona in combat. Powerful fusion attacks can be performed by combining two or more spells in the same round.The game introduces a "rumor system", which allows the player to acquire and spread rumors through rumormongers inhabiting the city. Due to the curse placed on the city, rumors become reality once they are spread. This predicament can be used to the player's advantage, for example by spreading a rumor about powerful black market weapons.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Disney•Pixar Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue!</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-06-01</td><td>Activision, Inc.</td><td>Traveller's Tales (UK) Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person, 3rd-person (Other), Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td>Contemporary</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td>Real-time</td><td>Everyone</td><td>Cinematic camera</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Woody has been stolen from the bedroom, ready to be sold to the highest bidder by an evil toy collector.

Some scenes were added and/or prolonged.While the main storyline remains the same in the remade version,  changes were made to some of the quests, dialogue, and motivations of some of the characters. A few characters that play a role in the plot development were added. Some of these changes affect the gameplay as well: for example, a certain character accompanies the party during a major quest in the remake, while in the original that character remained at home.Gameplay system also underwent significant changes. The most notable difference is the elimination of random battles; in the remake, enemies are visibly walking on the screen and can be avoided. Also, enemies no longer appear on the world map. The magic system of the game was altered to resemble the one from the original's  sequel. New items have been introduced, and the properties of some others changed.

Now he and his monkey army have taken over the Professor's time machine in order to to travel back in time and replace human civilization with a simian society. There's just one catch: Spike was caught in the time machine as well, and has been pulled back into the past with them. With the help of the Professor's numerous gadgets Spike will travel through prehistoric lands and capture Specter's army to prevent his evil scheme.Because of the game's requirement of a Dual Shock controller, all of Spike's items are controlled through the right stick. Examples include a stun stick that can be slashed in any direction or spun in a circle, an RC Car that can drive alongside Spike as he runs, and a helicopter blade that can be spun rapidly to lift Spike or slow his descent. The goal in every level is to capture enough of Specter's monkeys to diminish their effect on history. Each monkey has different stats and personalities. Some will barely pay attention to you and will prefer to goof off or sleep, while others will attack you with machine guns, rocket launchers, and UFOs. Weapons will only stun a monkey, and they must be captured using the Time Net.Finding every monkey in a level will unlock a time attack mode for the level, and collecting Specter Coins hidden in levels will unlock bonus games like boxing and skiing that use the dual stick controls.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Radikal Bikers</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-06-23</td><td>Infogrames Europe SA</td><td>Gaelco, S.A.</td><td>Racing / Driving</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade</td><td></td><td>Motorcycle, Street racing, Vehicle simulator</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Radikal Bikers is a game set in a Mediterranean environment in which players show off their motorbike skills while delivering pizzas.The game places two players in direct, head-to-head competition to deliver pizzas as fast as possible.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Fire Pro Wrestling G</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-06-24</td><td>Human Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>S-NEO Co., Ltd.</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Fire Pro Wrestling G is a 2D wrestling game that features over one hundred wrestlers worldwide, such as Bill Goldberg from WCW and The Rock from WWF.

There is, however, one big problem: these aliens are invisible! The little hero must use a device named "Cosmic" in order to locate them; but even then, it is necessary to take a full picture of the alien so that the rescue team will know where to search.So, how is it possible to take pictures of invisible beings?.. By carefully observing the environments and the behavior of humans and other animals. For example, if an animal appears to be afraid of something, there might be a chance an alien is nearby. Or, if something has changed in the scenery, perhaps an alien was at work there.UFO is essentially a puzzle game with adventure elements (navigating a character). The hero must travel to different rooms in the apartment building at different times, trying to snap the perfect picture of the invisible alien. The player is given a time limit and a picture limit (ten pictures per visit). Afterwards, the hero has to return to Mother, who will eat the negatives (really), produce pictures, and then decide whether they are suitable or not. Each successfully taken photo opens a new area and/or a new time of the day in the apartment block.UFO is  Love-de-lic's second game (after  Moon: Remix RPG Adventure). It shares a few stylistic traits and gameplay elements with its predecessor, such as the eccentric character design, the "gibberish" language with sub-titles, and the day/night cycle with character schedules as an important gameplay element.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Warzone 2100</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-06-25</td><td>Eidos, Inc.</td><td>Pumpkin Studios</td><td>Strategy</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td>War</td><td>Real-time strategy</td><td>Post-apocalyptic, Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td>Multiple units/characters control, Point and select</td><td>Real-time</td><td>Teen</td><td>Free-roaming camera</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Earth's defense satellites accidentally launch nuclear warheads due to computer malfunction.

As you make your way across the wasteland, hunting down artifacts and destroying hostile forces, you find out that the satellite's unexpected nuclear launch may not have been entirely accidental after all...You are in charge of searching the land for technological artifacts held by the other fellows.  These artifacts are then researched to create new weapons, chasses, and propulsion types, all of which are interchangable, meaning there are over 2000 units for you to blow stuff up with.  You can build tanks, hovercraft, Vertical Take Off/Landing (VTOL) vehicles, as well as cyborg units.  There are machine guns, missile launchers, flame throwers, mortars, etc.  Since all your technology comes from artifacts you swipe from your enemies, you are almost always fighting with weapons a step below what the other guy has, meaning you have to rely on your strategic prowess instead of sheer military superiority.  The battlefield is fully 3D, the camera is rotatable and zoomable, and all units are 3D as well, except for humans, which are sprites, but they aren't too plentiful, so it's a minor point.

Contrary to the first game's only area, the sequel has many different areas following different themes to explore. As the player gets closer to landforms or creatures, the silhouette becomes clearer and less blue or green, until it can be seen clearly. Instead of a reef where the encountered creatures are being shown, the game simply has a list of all the creatures. When a new animal is scanned with the submersible's sensor, a blue dot appears next to the scanned creature's name. Some of the animals can be interacted with. These initially have a pink dot appear next to their names instead of a blue one. When the possible interaction has been made, the dot turns blue.The animals found in the game represent a great variety of undersea wildlife from all around the world.

A sequel to both Tristan and Crystal Caliburn, the game features three tables based on the Arthurian legends: Camelot, Land's End and Fisher King. After completing all the missions on one table, the game moves to the next one. A practice mode is available to test the last two tables and prepare to the full game.In Camelot, the first table, the objective is to complete all quests, each assigned to a different knight of the round table. The screen shows two medieval banners with the table sitting at the middle. The banners list the active quests, the score, the number of balls left and the status of the game. To start one of the adventures, the player must shoot ramps, sink the ball in holes or drop targets a number of times and then hit the Taliessin holder near the Merlin ramp. Taliessin was a court jester, musician and poet, and he assigns the quests to the knights. When an event occurs, like the end of a quest, a small window appears over the table with a picture and text explaining the situation. After all the quests are complete, the game moves to the next table after hitting the drop targets for the sloth, envy and lust sins, and sinking the ball in the quest hole.In the second table called Land's End, Lancelot, Tristan and Gawain, the three knights considered the bravest of them all, must prove their courage by undertaking the most dangerous quests. A multiball starts after completing each adventure. Tristan has to kill the dragon, by shooting its ramp and turning on all the lights that spell its name, then sink the ball in the medicine and "myst" hole. Lancelot must lift the curse that fell upon Dolorous Gard, his castle, by shooting the castle ramp and turning on "CASTLE", and receive a gift from the Lady of the Lake after dropping the ball in the magic shield hole. Gawain has to defeat the Green Knight by hitting the "ERRANTRY" ramp to turn on the letter lights, and collect a proof of bravery from Lady Bercilak by getting the ball inside the sash hole. When all the quests are complete, the game switches back to Camelot automatically.In the final Fisher King table, the ultimate goal is to collect the holy grail from the castle. The three guardians of the grail (Perceval, Bors, and Galahad) must acquire the holy relic and bring it back to Camelot. They receive the aid of other three fellow knights: Balin, Gareth and Palomides. Balin must get the Longinus spear that pierced Jesus on the cross, by turning on its name hitting the "LONGINUS" spot targets, and enter the castle at the top of the table. Gareth has to defeat the three evil knights, by sinking the ball in the challenge hole and dropping the red, blue and black targets, and finally send the ball to the castle to start a multiball. Palomides must kill Arthur's sin, that became a monster after his death, by shooting the beast lane turning on the "BEAST" lights, and sinking the ball in the castle. The grail knights retrieve the sacred cup by hitting the holy targets and the Perceval hole, both activated after colliding with bumpers named after each knight, turning on the "HOLY GRAIL" letters at the center. A multiball starts after entering the castle and receiving the grail. After all modes are finished, the game returns to Camelot.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">SuperLite 1500 Series: Anokodokonoko Endless Season</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-07-22</td><td>Success Corp.</td><td>Success Corp.</td><td>Adventure, Simulation</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td>Board game, Dating simulation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">PlayStation Store Description (from Ad Blurbs)In simulation game "ANOKODOKONOKO ENDLESS SEASON", you have to befriend and become lovers with a girl within the given time.

Ruling from a castle built on the Pillars of Nosgoth, Kain has established an empire of six vampire clans, each ruled by a lieutenant, the sons of Kain. Raziel was one such lieutenant but lost his position through the insolence of receiving a new evolutionary "dark gift", the growth of feathery wings before his master had acquired it. Fearing that Raziel might one day surpass him, Kain tears off Raziel's wings in a fit of rage and banishes him into the Abyss. There, Raziel is lost in time, dead and his body consumed. The Elder God recovers Raziel's soul and rebuilds the broken body, not as a living vampire, but as a strange new creature of the underworld. Swearing revenge on Kain, Raziel now phases seamlessly between Nosgoth and its underworld, using his new powers to become a terrible reaver of souls...Soul Reaver is a third-person perspective action game with puzzle-solving and some platforming elements. The game follows Raziel on his quest to purge the land of vampires and take revenge on Kain and his brothers, leaders of the six clans. The player views the environment from behind Raziel's shoulder, moving him in any direction, climbing, attacking, jumping, and using specific abilities. Raziel can grip onto the edge of ledges and his torn wings allow him to glide gently downwards. He can also shift through the material world into the spectral realm at will but must find specific locations in order to shift back. The two realms mirror one another, with distortions which give access to new areas and platforms. Existing in the material world drains Raziel's life energy at a constant rate.  Throughout the game, energy is recovered by consuming the souls of defeated enemies. If Raziel is able to defeat one of his brothers, he will additionally gain a new ability ("dark gift") upon drinking his soul. Examples include: the ability to swim, file telekinetic projectiles, or the ability to phase through locked gates. Raziel can arm himself with a variety of weapons including spears, daggers, swords, axes, as well as attacking enemies barehanded. Eventually, he will also come across Kain's personal sword (named the Soul Reaver) and will use it to create a powerful energy blade weapon.The world is left open to Raziel, he can return to areas previously completed and explore the world of Nosgoth at will. Access to certain areas however sometimes requires the use of gained specific abilities. Many of the puzzles the player will need to solve in this quest are block puzzles, requiring the placement of certain large structures (usually square blocks), either to activate switches or to build access to out-of-reach areas.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">NFL GameDay 2000</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-08-01</td><td>Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc.</td><td>989 Studios</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In addition to all the features you expect from this series, this version of GameDay includes one-handed grabs, diving into the end zone, and running out of bounds and slamming into the coach.

As a result Toshinden 4 was "old school" for its time.While Toshinden 4 models it's game play more off Toshinden 1 and Toshinden 2 than 3, it makes what is perhaps the biggest change in the series; it does away with nearly all of the 40+ characters that the series has built up and replaces them with 13 almost completely new characters; only 3 of Toshinden 4's cast have appeared in previous games.But even they are notably different as Toshinden 4 takes place sometime after Toshinden 3 story wise, hence they have aged. The new cast has some pretty big links to the old cast however and many of their stories and bio's reference the old cast even though most aren't named directly (for instance Lancelot was sent to a certain French noble man to be toughened up, while Fen met a certain spear wielding warrior that his own fighting style is conveniently similar to).Graphically, Toshinden 4 sacrifices detail for fluid animation and speed, to the point where the original Toshinden arguably looks better overall.The combo system is once again redone; now the player can make a combo out of any combination of light and hard attacks (high, low and jumping) with the limits that they can only enter each attack once (i.e only one high light slash, one low hard kick etc) and once a hard attack has been inputted, no further light attacks can be entered into the combo. Special attacks have also become more special, generally being considerably more dramatic and requiring more complex button combinations that the past games.Toshinden 4 also tweaks the series overdrive attacks; now each character has at least two and the bar is split into three segments; one block is used per overdrive attack, though all three can be saved up to activate the new Kishin Kourin attack which bestows a considerable ability increase at the cost of health.A simple parrying system has been added to Toshinden 4; the player can attempt to repel any weapon based attack or they can use a special counter attack that can counter almost anything, but uses up an overdrive block.Toshinden 4 introduces multiple arena types to the series; for the first time there are arenas with no edges as well as the standard square and round arenas one can be knocked off for a ring out. Toshinden 4 also introduces a third type of arena to the series; collapsing arenas. As the match goes on holes randomly form in the arena (though warning is given as to where they are about to form). As if to compensate for this new arena type, it is no longer possible to fall off an edge of the ring unless you are hit off or accidently perform a move that takes you over the edge.As well as the standard fighting aspect, Toshinden 4 also has seven time unlocked themed "mini games", that include breakout, air hockey and a dancing game.There is also a comprehensive database mode to unlock that includes detailed information about every character, sound bites, a jute box and character design sketches including some rejected costumes.As well as all these extras, Toshinden 4 has pretty much every fighting game mode out there.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Madden NFL 2000</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-08-17</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>EA Tiburon</td><td>Sports</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Multiple units/characters control</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">John Madden brings the best football back to PC, bigger than ever!

Within months of introducing their first products, Toy-Volt shot to the top! No one could put their finger on exactly what it was that made the toys so popular. Sure, they employed the best designers and marketers in the world, but there was something else about Toy-Volt toys, something almost.... magic. Now, their newest R/C cars really start to live! Re-Volt is a racing game where you take control over one of more than 28 R/C cars and drive on one of the 13 tracks. The tracks are varied, and include a toy shop, a supermarket, a luxury liner and more. It is possible to play a "reversed" (backwards) or "mirror" (reversed left and right) variety of each track. There are also 4 levels of realism to choose from. There are a couple of single- and multiplayer game modes to choose from. There's a Single Race, where you complete a single track while competing with several computer-controlled opponents; a Championship, where you try to complete a series of races in hopes of finishing on the top; and Multiplayer, where you play with live opponents. There's also a Time Trial, where you're alone on the track, and simply try to get as best a time as possible; a Practice mode, where you're free to drive around a track to learn its structure and shortcuts; and the Stunt Arena, where you drive around a special arena and try to collect stars situated in hard-to-reach places. In Single Race, Championship and Multiplayer there are power-ups scattered throughout the track; picking them up gives you a one-use random power, such as missiles to launch at pesky opponents, a star to temporarily freeze competitors in place or a lightning bolt, which makes your car shock opponents nearby to make them stop. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Taikou Risshiden III</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-08-19</td><td>KOEI Co., Ltd.</td><td>KOEI Co., Ltd.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Japan (Ancient/Classical/Medieval)</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Taikou Risshiden III is the third entry in Taikō Risshiden series.The game is the most restricted game in the series as it only contains 2 playable characters: Toyotomi Hideyoshi (aka.

Help Lammy get to her latest gig on time, and face obstacles such as flaming buildings, out-of-control airplanes, and even getting trapped in Hell.In this sequel to PaRappa The Rapper you play as Lammy, a guitarist for MilkCan - the coolest, hippest band ever!  While PaRappa focused on lyrics, with each button controlling a different word; Lammy is a guitar player, so naturally, each button controls a different note on the guitar.  Lammy will encounter seven different teachers on her travels to the big gig, so either follow their lessons accurately, or do even better - improvise and blow them all away with your axe.  The teacher will then step away for you to go it solo for an even better performance.Lammy improves over PaRappa in a multitude of ways.  Rather than just being a single player experience, you can now play the game with a friend.  Any stages that you unlock can be played either co-operatively or competitively.  If you don't have a friend to play co-operatively with, you can also get the computer to take on the role of your partner.  After finishing the initial game, PaRappa also makes a return, allowing you to play through the game again with raps instead of Lammy's guitar.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Dance Dance Revolution: 2nd Mix</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-08-25</td><td>Konami Corporation</td><td>Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo, Inc.</td><td>Simulation</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td>Music / rhythm</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This is the second rendition of the popular dance simulation.

Nearly all actions in the game are decided by dice rolls, including the monsters fought, the effect of attacks and item use, contents of treasures, and even the layout of the dungeon itself -- entering an unmapped square will start a roll that decides the type of space that goes there.The player controls a party of up to four adventurers as they explore the different dungeons. The goal is simply to explore until all possible routes are exhausted, while collecting experience and treasure from enemies, and ideally not dying. The player can leave the dungeon through the entrance at any time, but completing a dungeon will award a bonus based on the size of the dungeon. Between dungeons, the player returns to an unnamed town, where items can be bought or sold, wounded characters can be healed, the team can be rearranged, and the game saved or loaded.There are four different classes available: Fighters, who excel at physical combat; Priest / Priestesses, who can heal other characters; Thieves, who have a chance to disarm trap tiles; and Sorcerer / Sorceresses, who have access to magic attacks. Characters of any class can be either male or female, and the player can freely mix and match classes in their party. Each character has their own items, experience, and gold, and cannot share or trade with each other. The game has no story.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">SuperLite 1500 Series: Angolmois99</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-08-26</td><td>Success Corp.</td><td>Success Corp.</td><td>Strategy</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Board game, Cards / tiles</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">PlayStation Store Description (from Ad Blurbs)"Angolmois99" is an addictive simple card game based on the prophecy of Nostradamus and includes real-life parody.

Rather than a game that just requires you to try and win the race, this game gives you points to destroy the other racers' cars.  The game has many styles of game play so you don't have to play the same style each game.There are 5 game styles in the Single Race section of the game.  This section does not count towards unlocking cars or tracks.  It is for practice and just plain fun.  The main style is Demolition.In Demolition, you race against other cars around the track and get points for hitting them, spinning them in circles and knocking them into the wall.  You also get a big bonus for landing on top of a car which will immediately destroy the car.  When you finish the race, your final position is
found by multiplying the points you got from hitting the other cars with the points that you got for the position you finished in.  So if you finish first, but never hit anyone, you won't win the race.The next style is The Chase.  This style is your normal race game.  You can still take damage and so can the other cars, but you are only trying to win the race.  You don't get any points for hitting the other cars.Chicken is another style.  It is the same as The Chase except that you drive in the opposite direction as everyone else.  This can slow you down when you run into the cars coming around from the other direction.The next 2 game styles aren't done on race tracks.  They are done in an arena.  This is a circle area which may have hills in it where you just try to destroy cars.  The first of these is Last Man Standing.  In this style, you try to destroy every car without being destroyed yourself.  You can still win if you
aren't the last car by making a lot of points by hitting other cars.  The scoring is calculated the same as the Demolition style.The final Single Race style is Suicide.  In this style, you try to destroy yourself before any others are destroyed.  You don't get any points for hitting other cars in this style.Besides the Single Race, there is also League Racing.  In League racing, you are trying to beat a set of tracks.  There are 4 leagues on tracks and one league in the arena.  In order to beat a track (or arena), you must place in a certain position.  The first league starts out easy; you can finish in 5th place and still beat the track and go on to the next one.  However, as you go up in difficulty of leagues, you will eventually have to place 1st on every track in the league to beat it.  A league will usually have 5-10 tracks to beat.After you beat a league, you will unlock cars, tracks and other leagues.  There are 11 tracks, 3 arenas and 8 cars that you can get.  The cars can be customized with colors and logos.  You can also have portraits of the racers on top of the cars.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Jet Moto 3</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-08-31</td><td>989 Studios</td><td>Pacific Coast Power & Light</td><td>Action, Racing / Driving</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td>Naval / watercraft</td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The third entry in the Jet Moto series once again places you in the driving seat of a futuristic hoverbike, racing at breakneck speed in a truly extreme sport. While a Jet Moto hoverbike might look like a jet ski, it is capable of far more: it travels across land as well as water and can use a magnetic grapple to make extremely tight turns. During a race, drivers must skillfully time jumps, dodge obstacles, and contend with some feisty opponents who won't hesitate to bump you into a tree or maybe even knock you off a cliff.Jet Moto 3 offers ten different riders and 19 tracks across the wide open ocean, over mountainous terrain, and through cityscapes. As with the earlier games, two people can still race in a split-screen mode.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">NHL FaceOff 2000</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-08-31</td><td>Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc.</td><td>989 Studios</td><td>Sports</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Red Wings Coach Scotty Bowman helped improve NHL FaceOff 2000.

In the tutorial mode, players go to fishing classes and learn and practice the basics of fishing starting with casting all the way down to bass ecology. At the end of all the classes the player is given an exam testing them on all they have previously learned. Free fishing mode let's the player fish at their leisure, letting them choose from 5 different lakes and setting its' conditions to their liking, and let's them attempt to catch any of the 14 species of fish that inhabit those lakes. The B.A.S Pro-Tournament mode has the player competing in 7 different tournaments by catching a set number of the most heaviest bass in a set amount of time.Before heading out to fish the player can choose their type of rod, reel, lure, and line. When fishing the player chooses the way to cast their line, use a power meter to determine how far out the line is cast, and then hope to lure a fish on to their hook.Options in the game let the player decide things such as the time scale, rod action, and indicator type. Their is also a record option that keeps track of all the data about the various fish that have been caught in the free fishing and tournament modes. The player can also save replays of the catches that they deem to be noteworthy.

On the eve of AlphaCore's complete assimilation of all technology, humanity becomes aware of it, and rather than bow down to it as king, as it expected, they attempt to purge it from the network. In response AlphaCore defends itself, locking all of humanity out of their technology and assuming total control of their weapons. Not long after this AlphaCore learns of a desperate plot: to build a time machine and travel back in time to remove AlphaCore's influence from humanity. AlphaCore steals this technology and hatches its own plan: traveling back in time to 1945 and inserting itself into the first computer ever built, ensuring that humanity would forever be subtle pawns in its machinations. It now falls upon the shoulders of Lester J. Henning, pilot of the experimental robot weapon Omega Boost, to travel back in time, stop AlphaCore's plan, and restore free choice to humanity.The Omega Boost flies through levels on a predetermined path, although it can brake and boost in a direction to avoid hazards. The Omega Boost can fire a Vulcan rifle at enemies without targeting, or can lock on to and attack many targets at once with a homing laser. By scoring well in levels, the Omega Boost will gain the ability to lock onto more targets at once, and eventually unlock the Viper Boost, a powerful area attack that must cool down after being used. Levels completed in campaign mode can be replayed at your leisure in Zone mode, and bonus levels can be unlocked as well by achieving certain milestones.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-09-01</td><td>LucasArts Entertainment Company LLC</td><td>Big Ape Productions, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">There is a disturbance in the force, and the Jedi are there to find its source.

This is a collection of the arcade games Hyper Bishi Bashi Champ and Gachaga Champ bundled into one game, which only saw a Japanese release.The mini-games themselves are very straightforward and usually involve using only the Triangle, X, and O buttons. This is a direct holdover from the original layout of the arcade machines, which only featured a three button layout. In the console release there is sometimes the option to use the analog stick or the D-pad as well to increase the button-mashing even further. Examples of these types of games (timing vs. mashing): in one game the player has to fend off mobsters by pressing the button placed in the direction they're coming from and in another the player simply has to mash buttons as fast as possible to run towards a soccer goal while trying to time jumping over the opposing team's players.The games can either be played alone, against a computer player, or with a friend.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Mega Man 2</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-09-02</td><td>Capcom Co., Ltd.</td><td>Capcom Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Platform, Shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">After defeating Dr. Light's six robots that were reprogrammed by the villainous Dr. Wily in Mega Man, it seemed like the world was safe.

In the process they discover that there are other characters pulling strings from behind the stage, and eventually uncover a mystery that involves two decades of secrets hidden both from the world and from themselves.Final Fantasy VIII is set in a "retro" environment reminiscent in some ways of the 1960's, with a few sci-fi and plenty of supernatural elements mixed in. The basic system resembles those of its predecessors: the player navigates a party of characters over a world map, accessing various locations and fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat of the series' trademark ATB (active time battle) variety. However, character development system has been re-designed.Player-controlled characters in the game have no defined character classes. They can be customized by equipping magic spells, which can be "drawn" from enemies in battles. When used in combat, spells act like expendable items; there are no MP (magic points) in the game. When equipped, they act like armor, raising or lowering character parameters, including resistances to various kinds of magic (elemental, status-changing, etc.). Monster summons (called Guardian Forces in the game) play a very important role in the customization process. They can be "junctioned" to to the characters, acquire ability points (AP) earned from battles along with experience, learn and "teach" characters new abilities, and can also be summoned in battles. Each character can also execute unique powerful attacks or support actions when his or her hit points are low. Many of these attacks require the player to press specific buttons at the right moment to increase their power. New weapons are constructed by collecting materials and bringing them to a blacksmith. The player does not acquire money from random enemies, but instead receives paychecks over time based on the player character's SeeD rank. This rank increases when the characters defeat enemies in battles without summoning Guardian Forces; when the player takes SeeD tests within the game; or, occasionally, when the player chooses a correspondent action or decision for the protagonist during some of the missions. Payments are regular and are calculated by the amount of steps the characters make.Visually, the game resembles its predecessor, featuring 3D graphics for battles and world map exploration, and pre-rendered backgrounds for individual locations. The game's 3D character models are realistically proportioned (as opposed to the "super-deformed" character graphics of the previous game), and the influence of anime art is less noticeable.Like the previous installment, Final Fantasy VIII features several mini-games, the most prominent of which is the card game Triple Triad. Cards can be won in matches or acquired through side quests or by transforming enemy monsters. Many characters in the game can be challenged to a game of Triple Triad, so it is always possible to take a break from saving the world to play cards with the locals.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Formula Nippon</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-09-09</td><td>Eon Digital Entertainment</td><td>TYO Entertainment Inc.</td><td>Racing / Driving, Simulation</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Automobile, Track racing, Vehicle simulator</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This is a race game based on a real open wheel Japanese series called "Formula Nippon" (originally based from F3000).

Likewise, points will be deducted if you cut your fingers when chopping or burn your french fries. Tougher cuisines will require more steps, will offer fewer chances for chaining, and will require speed, precision, and careful resource management in order for you to advance.

It's quite similar, in all respects, to other Mega Man games; however, this is the first time that you get a sidekick. It's also the first time you're allowed to slide instead of merely walking. Rush is your dog who helps out by offering other modes of transportation when you need it. He starts out with the 'Rush Coil' ability to launch you to the top of the screen like a springboard; later he acquires the 'Rush Jet' ability to turn into a guided, floating platform to carry you wherever you need to go; and he also gets the 'Rush Marine' ability which is a submarine that works just like the jet except underwater and with the added ability to hop around out of the water (you can actually jump while on the jet but the jet continues to hover beneath you whereas you stay inside the submarine). All of these abilities function just like boss weapons.When you defeat the boss at the end of a level you gain his power - or at least a similar power. You may pause the game at any time and switch to any single power you have. It supplants your regular Arm Cannon with a limited - but superior - ability. The weapon ammo is displayed next to your energy meter. There are eight of these, corresponding to the eight main levels, even though there are twenty-one levels in the entire game. Enemies will often supply you with both energy and ammo refills. You can also collect Energy Tanks which can only be used once but will entirely restore your health. You start the game with three lives. Other features include Surprise Boxes lying around for you to find. There are infinite continues and a password feature to resume play at the beginning of any level.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Purumui Purumui</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-09-14</td><td>Culture Publishers Company</td><td>F2 Company</td><td>Action, Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kiyohiko Takehisa (竹久 清彦 （F2）)</td><td>Real-time</td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">One day in the peaceful village of Puru in the world of Fillip Side, Mui and Popuri were playing in the forest.

The game contains stages made by players of Tsumu with its built-in stage editor, from a contest that was advertised in that game. Tsumu Light itself does not feature an editor anymore though.

To do so, a photo must be placed in a folder, imported and then hotspots (head shape, eyes, nose and mouth) must be set, to define how the texture will be mapped into the face model. Gameplay became a lot faster and tougher, and two new moves were included: "Big Hit", to flatten the oppositions' golden boy, and "Special Movement", to go around those tough defenders with ease.  Other new features include individual player and goalie boost (to give an handicap for a team), jersey selection, including classic throwback jerseys.One of the most important changes done to the game was how the game timer worked: before, the period length on the clock matched the time set by the player, but starting with NHL 2000, every period has 20 minutes which are compressed into the time set by the player. This makes penalties a lot shorter (a minor elapses in just 30 seconds in a five minute period setting) thus reducing the powerplay percentage, which experienced players could keep in the high 90's in previous games, but also fixes the handicap of goaltenders in played games (a goaltender that suffered a single goal would have his GAA a lot higher than a goalie that suffered more goals in a simulated game).The rest of the game remains as usual: 28 teams can play in a season (with the ability to choose between a short, medium or long season length), setting the then new NHL overtime loss point, playoffs (with best of 1, 3, 5 or 7 matches), international tournament and shootout. The beginner mode continues to be featured, and allowing players to feel the ice for the first time without having to deal with complicated controls, penalties or tough opponents.

The government that funded his research wrote the whole affair off as a loss, which made it all the more upsetting when reports of Dr. Kirk's good health and nearly finished research came in. A special forces team is sent to the doctor's private island laboratory to extract him and his research, but they are totally unprepared for some of the side effects of his developments. Side effects that come from 100 million years in the past.Dino Crisis is a survival horror game that is very similar in both control and gameplay to its sister series, Resident Evil. As in that series, protagonist Regina will have limited supplies and ammo with which to fight deadly enemies while searching rooms for keys (some figurative, some literal) to open locked areas. Unlike Resident Evil games, Regina will find very few actual supplies laying around, and will instead find "plugs" that are used to open caches of emergency supplies located around the complex. There are only enough plugs to open some of these caches, however, so care must be taken to decide what items are really needed. In another change from Resident Evil, the game is rendered in 3D, allowing the camera to rotate or pan, although camera angles are still out of the control of the player. Even the dumbest dinosaur is smarter than the undead, and enemies can chase and disarm Regina, and even occasionally follow her through doors. Regina can use the force fields in the complex to block her enemies.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">G-Police: Weapons of Justice</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-09-24</td><td>Psygnosis Limited</td><td>Psygnosis Limited</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Further adventures in the G-Police world - more flying around in a futuristic helicopter-style vehicle, shooting things.

The main bulk of the gameplay, however, is traditional RPG exploration and character growth. Together with turn-based party combat, which allows up to six active player-controlled combatants, there are also a few strategic battles, which are quite different from those of the first Suikoden: the player has to move squads on a grid field, trying to surround the enemies and eventually defeat them.Characters can equip runes that allow them to cast a limited amount of magic spells; unlike the first game, it is possible to equip up to three runes on a single character.

The matters become further complicated when Tomoya meets an attractive new transfer student, forcing him to sort out his preferences and abandon his usual cynical approach to love.Memories Off is a visual novel. Most of the game consists of text superimposed on still anime-style visuals. The interaction is restricted to occasional choices the player must make when prompted by the story development. Depending on these decisions the plot may advance into any of the six distinct branches, leading to different endings.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">NHL Championship 2000</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-09-30</td><td>Fox Interactive, Inc.</td><td>Radical Entertainment Inc.</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">NHL Championship 2000 is a hockey game licensed by the NHL, NHLPA and the FOX Sports channel, which allowed the developers to use not only the likeness of their broadcasting graphics and the Fox Trax technology, but also the voice support of game broadcasters John Davidson and Kenny Albert.One of the key aspects of the game are the passing indicators, which always show which players are open for a pass, allowing a quick, smooth passing play.

Until one day, he met something and someone who he couldn't beat. A group of ninja assassins, the Jackal Organization, were harassing the town and Johnny brave as he was, got shot down. Johnny though, he didn't die... he refused to die... and sought the help of his father's friend Suzuki, who was a master of the legendary Zipang arts...Johnny went away then... to learn the skills that would help him win and train hard to beat his opponents.

Zan proceeds through enemies and challenges in each level to eventually reach the boss who he then battles in some form of specialized combat or pattern. Once the boss is defeated, Zan gets the chance to unleash as much punishment on his foe in 30 seconds as he can; higher damage values will change the finishing move he uses to slay his foe.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">South Park</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-09-30</td><td>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Iguana Entertainment Incorporated</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person</td><td>Licensed</td><td>Comedy</td><td>Shooter</td><td>North America, Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">A comet is heading toward South Park, causing many of the enemies from early seasons of the shows (including cows, aliens, and clones) to rise up and attack.

Features new dialogue from the original voice actors on the show.Single player takes the form of a "Story" mode divided into five episodes and fifteen linear levels.  The player will face weak minions (which change based on the episode), plus occasional sub-bosses which will try to escape into town. The final level is devoted to a unique boss fight.  Players use quirky weapons ranging from infinite yellow snowballs to cow launchers and toxic Terrance and Phillip dolls.  Every weapon has a secondary fire, and players switch between the four main characters when they switch weapons - each of the four kids shares a single life bar because of this.  The kids will comment on game actions as they occur, with heavier profanity censored with bleeps.  The kids will get angrier (and fouler) as their health depletes, until they finally give up on saving the town and go home.A multiplayer mode lets players take characters and weapons they unlock in Story mode into small deathmatch arenas. The PlayStation version supports 2 players, the N64 does 4, and the PC version allows players to go online to search for opponents through GameSpy.  Players can set standard victory options like knockouts or time limits.  Voice samples for multiplayer are also included, so the characters will make comments and taunts when hit.Graphics are rendered in 3D, in a style approximating that of the show.  Draw distance is limited by a heavy fog, with varying severity based on the platform.  None of the environments are interactive, and only enemies respond to weapon hits.

It's a Radio Controlled model flight simulation that fully utilizes the PlayStation analog controller. The player view is selectable as either stationary (as with a real R/C helicopter), walking or flying behind the helicopter.

 You can do training, stunts, complete mission objectives, multiplayer head-to-head, or free flight, using one of five different models of tiny helicopters in 3rd person view.

 The game starts a new player with an obligatory training section to teach you how the helicopter flies, in which you use a helicopter with a frame attached to prevent crashes and with limited maneuverability - no looping/rolls. Using this beginner model you are graded and may qualify for flying other more capable models than the trainer.
 Only after completing the training, you can fly stunts or do missions. Stunts include for example shooting at targets, flying through hoops, doing rolls and loops, and flying inverted.

 In the two-player competition mode you can shoot at your opponent's helicopter, and cause it to crash.

 All your flights are graded and also commented upon by an instructor, who will either over-enthusiastically applaud your success or sarcastically ridicule you for the often spectacular failures.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Xena: Warrior Princess</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-10-05</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Universal Digital Arts, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Xena: Warrior Princess is an action game based on the TV series of the same name.

The game takes place in Hirumi City, a fictitious Japanese suburb containing commercial areas, hospitals, construction sites, and parks, in the late 1990s. Despite the fact that it is never mentioned, it is hinted that the city sprang from Japan's economic boom in the 1980s and has since fallen into ruin. The narrative follows three junior high school students as they investigate local urban legends, most of which have a paranormal component. A kid named Nao and his dog Meros, as well as two girls named Kurumi and Sango, are among the students.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Zill O'll</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-10-07</td><td>KOEI Co., Ltd.</td><td>KOEI Co., Ltd.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">It is the year 1200 in the timeline of the Vyashion continent. The evil Emperor Balor, ruler of the Dyneskal Empire, has been defeated, and an era of relatively peaceful co-existence between the continent's various races began. However, a new threat arises when the sleeping Dragon King awakens beneath his secluded island. Supervising the life of humans, the Dragon King prefers to keep them in a state of perpetual war, so that no faction would gain the upper hand, believing that is the only way to uphold balance. An adventurer who possesses the unique gift of the Infinite Soul, granting him or her the greatest power of choice, rises to the challenge of shaping the fate of humanity.Zill O'll is a Japanese role-playing game with several distinguishing characteristics. The basic mechanics follow the convention of the genre, with simple turn-based combat (against enemies visibly walking on-screen during exploration) and semi-automatic leveling. Player-controlled character can also learn various skills and raise elemental affinities which play a role in combat. Defeating enemies quickly bestows benefits on the party.  The game's unusual features lie in its scenario system. The player creates the main character by choosing his or her gender, answering a few moral questions, and choosing the initial location. Depending on these combinations the initial quest will be different, though after a while all the prologues merge into a single main plot. Despite being largely linear, this plot can be affected to a degree by decisions made by the player. Locations can be visited by selecting a destination on the world map. Each trip takes a certain amount of time, which must be taken into consideration in conjunction with the events of the main plot.The player is also free to complete quests in any order. Plot-dictated events (e.g. outbreak of a war) will normally occur regardless of the player's input. Important characters may stay alive or die depending on the player's choices and level of involvement in their personal quests. In addition, towns offer guild quests coming in five varieties - delivery, escort, discovery, slay, and rescue. These quests may open new areas and grant the party experience as well as special Soul points, which are used to steer a character in a direction corresponding to a certain class.The lead character also has unique attributes such as bravery, kindness, etc. These attributes may be affected by the player's choices and also influence the hero's relationships with other characters. These relationships are measured according to the emotion of the character in question, ranging from hatred to adoration, and eventually determine the character's fate during the story's conclusion.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Zipangujima: Unmei wa Saikoro ga Kimeru!?</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-10-07</td><td>Human Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Act Studio</td><td>Strategy</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Historical events, Japan (Ancient/Classical/Medieval), Medieval</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Isometric</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">PlayStation Store Description (from Ad Blurbs)To download content to the Memory Stick PRO Duo™ of your PSP® (PlayStation®Portable) system, the free space required is twice the size of the content to be downloaded.This software is playable for PLAYSTATION®3 and PSP® (PlayStation®Portable).To play this software on your PLAYSTATION®3 system, you must have at least 35MB of free space on your PLAYSTATION®3 system hard disk.To play this software on your PSP®, you must install the latest system software version and have a Memory Stick Duo™ with the free space stated above.For more detailed information about downloading to your PSP® system, please see URL below.http://asia.playstation.comWhen downloading using PC:When downloading contents to PSP®, you must install the PLAYSTATION®Network Downloader application first.

This happens by filling up a gauge each time the player absorbs one of the auras, and allowing transformation into one of the three types by visiting a mirror.
The game then uses these transformations to solve puzzles throughout, such as having Laika become “red” in order to lift heavy objects.The battle system is somewhat akin to Pong, in that the player has to deflect enemy projectiles in order inflict damage himself, by using something called a Mind Core.
Battles only occur when Laika is transformed into one of the alter egos.Like many RPGs of its day, Planet Laika uses 3D polygonal characters with 2D pre-rendered backgrounds, along with CG cutscenes.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Poketan</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-10-21</td><td>Sony Computer Entertainment Inc., Sugar & Rockets, Inc.</td><td>HI Corporation, Sugar & Rockets, Inc.</td><td>Educational</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Poketan is a game focused on helping Japanese speakers improve their English vocabulary.

Each level packs one hundred words, giving this game a total of sixteen hundred vocabulary words.The game has two modes, card mode, and test mode. In card mode one can chose to receive flash cards going from either Japanese to English, of English to Japanese. You will first see either a Kanji or English word then after you've made you guess as to its counterpart in the opposing language, you can find out exactly what that word is with the touch of a button. Particularly difficult to pronounce, or easily confused words (i.e. ear, air), have an option that will allow one to hear a sound clip giving the appropriate pronunciation.Test Mode will test the knowledge of what one has learned from card mode. You will be faced with Kanji and have to input the correct corresponding English word. A wrong letter will be corrected. As one wins one will be rewarded by "Transformations" of Specter. As one progress through the provided vocabulary, Specter transforms into various shape, car, dog, rain, etc., and will use the words learned in a variety of sentences.While playing on a Playstation you will essentially play on a giant simulated Pocketstation. If playing on a Pocketstation you can upload the results of our tests to the Playstation, from where Specters Transformations can be watched.

Striking at the right time or with the right ability can even delay or cancel an enemy's turn.The characters in the game gradually advance in level as they gain experience points for killing monsters. Characters also gain experience based on the weapon (e.g. sword, mace, whip, etc.) or magic (e.g. fire, water, etc.) that they use, powering up their spells and learning new ones from continuous usage.

The player give an artillery piece a shot angle and shot power, and try to hit the opponent, taking into account wind effects. The player and the opponent exchange these shots in a turn-based fashion. The game puts the player in command of a team of up to eight worms, which can move around the landscape (one at a time), using many types of weapons to try to dispatch the enemy, from bazookas to mini-guns to exploding sheep. In some situations, the worms can also jump, swing by rope, and descend with a parachute.As of 2002, updates have been handled by an authorized community member named Deadcode, who was joined in 2006 by CyberShadow. The two have removed many bugs and glitches, improved game stability and compatibility for Windows operating systems that have been released along the way, added new features (more resolutions, expanded options and settings, auto-recorded match replays, full PNG support for map importing...) and integrated WormKit, an extension framework for the game which allows for easier modding. These updates have been available from Team17's servers and are included by default in subsequent digital releases.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Chrono Trigger</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-11-02</td><td>Square Co., Ltd.</td><td>Square Co., Ltd.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Japanese-style RPG (JRPG)</td><td>Fantasy, Sci-fi / futuristic, Steampunk</td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td>Koji Sugimoto, Ken Narita</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">A young man named Crono is about to enjoy a carefree day: he plans to go to the Millennial Fair, where his friend Lucca intends to demonstrate her newest scientific invention: a teleporter. Upon his arrival, Crono meets a young girl named Marle, who volunteers to be the first to test Lucca's new device. However, Marle's pendant affects the teleporter's mechanism in a mysterious way, and as a result, she is teleported four hundred years into the past. Crono and Lucca quickly recreate the time portal and follow Marle. They find out that her unexpected appearance has created some confusion, and proceed to fix the error, which in turn leads to unforeseen consequences, eventually compelling the heroes to travel to different time periods and change the history of the world.Chrono Trigger is a Japanese-style role-playing game in which the player takes control of a party consisting of up to seven characters, developing the combat skills of its members and managing their equipment. There are no random encounters in the game: all the enemies are either visibly walking on the field maps and can be avoided by the player, or are waiting to ambush the party. No enemy encounters occur when the player navigates characters over the world map.The game utilizes the ATB (active time battle) combat system from  Final Fantasy games as one of the combat style selections offered to the player in the beginning. The other selectable battle mechanic pauses combat whenever the player accesses the menu, effectively removing the real-time element and rendering the battles fully turn-based.As the characters grow in power, their parameters increase, and they learn new "techs" - special powerful attacks and maneuvers which cost them magic points to use in battle. Techs may target a specific formation of enemies (e.g. a line) and can be used tactically depending on the enemies' positioning in combat. Characters may execute techs individually or perform double or triple techs, where each character contributes a tech which is combined with one or two others to unleash a powerful attack.Once player-controlled characters acquire the ability to travel freely between time periods, the game's plot develops in a non-linear fashion. From that point on the player may opt to face the game's final adversary in combat and complete the story, or perform other plot-related quests. Depending on the moment of the story when the player decides to proceed to the final battle, the game may be concluded with thirteen different endings. The New Game+ option allows the player to start the game anew after having previously completed it, carrying over levels, techs, and equipment of the characters. The PlayStation version features an anime-style introduction movie and cutscenes, a "movie theater" mode which allows the player to re-watch these movies and listen to the game's songs, as well as an unlockable bestiary, dungeon maps, and art gallery. The Nintendo DS version retains these changes and adds two new dungeons and a new possible ending that foreshadows the events of Chrono Cross.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Submarine Commander</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-11-02</td><td>Victor Interactive Software, Inc.</td><td>Sol</td><td>Strategy</td><td></td><td></td><td>War</td><td>Wargame</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td>Naval / watercraft</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Back of Jewel Case - PlayStation (EU) (from Ad Blurbs)Introducing a whole new gaming experience....

In a race against time, Lara must use all of her wit and skill to re-imprison Set and save the world from Armageddon. Pursued at every turn by her arch-rival, the unscrupulous archaeologist Werner Von Croy, Lara embarks on a journey of discovery across Egypt, where she must overcome the most ingenious puzzles and infernal traps ever devised, and face terrifying evil from beyond the grave...Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation plays very similar to the previous games in the series, but some new things have been added to the game. The biggest addition is that now rather large parts of the game consist of several interconnected levels sometimes explored in any order, with puzzles in one level often requiring that some actions are done in other levels. The new additions to Lara's arsenal are a revolver and a bow with several sets of arrows including exploding and poisonous ones. The players will also find a laser sight that can be attached to any of the two weapons described above allowing manual targeting and zooming. Inventory now holds a binocular with a built-in flashlight and a handy crowbar (found later in the game). Lara has also learned a few new moves: she can climb into the niches with low ceilings if the crouch button is pressed, she can now move around the corners while hanging and she can also pull levers and open trap-doors while jumping. Graphics have been upgraded too - there are new light effects and water is now dripping from Lara's clothes when she gets on the surface.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">007: Tomorrow Never Dies</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-11-16</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Black Ops Entertainment, LLC</td><td>Action</td><td>Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td>Spy / espionage</td><td>Shooter</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In 007: Tomorrow Never Dies, which is based on the movie of the same name, the player takes the role of the famous James Bond who fights against Elliot Carver.

Now it is Bond's responsibility to set things right...Most of the ten levels are like traditional third-person-shooters where the player walks around the levels while killing numerous foes. While there is an option for a free aim most enemies can be dispatched with the auto-lock function. This means if the player gets close enough to an enemy while using an appropriate gun the game automatically shoots at him when the player faces the general direction. Bond also has gadgets to his disposal which are used to fulfill the mission goals. There are two missions which differ from this formula: in the driving sequence the player chases and shoots at enemy cars while avoiding obstacles; during the skiing part he is mainly concerned with dispatching other skiers which want to bring him out of balance.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-11-16</td><td>Midway Home Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Midway Games, Inc.</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC is a descendant of the original NBA Jam, and is created by some of the key team members.

The most significant differences are the track editor, improved graphics, and new game modes. There are 84 tracks and the game supports multiplayer with up to four players. This second installment comes with four game modes: an arcade mode for casual rally fans, a championship mode for people who want to compete against other rally cars for a title, a trophy mode, and a time trial mode.It features 16 different cars in three categories: World Rally Cars (Peugeot 206, Hyundai Coupe, Mitsubishi Lancer, Toyota Corolla, Subaru Impreza, Ford Focus, SEAT Córdoba, Škoda Octavia), 2L kit-cars (Peugeot 306, Citroën Xsara, SEAT Ibiza, Renault Megane, Vauxhall Astra) and 1.6L kit-cars (Citroën Saxo, Peugeot 106, Nissan Micra). A number of bonus cars can be unlocked as well by completing certain modes, such as winning the European or the World Championship.In the arcade mode you race against three opponents on the race track; whoever reaches the finish line first after a series of laps wins the stage. However, the main goal in a stage is to reach the next checkpoint before the countdown timer stops. Several stages form a level, for which you receive a total of three credits. Every time you fail to reach a checkpoint before the time runs out the race stops and you can use a credit to restart that particular stage. If there are no credits left, the entire level must be restarted. The trophy mode is a bit different. While winning a stage is still done by beating three opponents directly on the race track, to claim the trophy you have to register the best overall result, calculated by summing up all the stages' times.The championship mode is designed after the FIA World Rally Championship, where drivers compete for points. The European championship is divided into eight rounds, while the World and the Expert championships each have twelve. Every round has two (European, World) or three stages (Expert). This is the only mode where the car gets damaged if handled badly, but it can be repaired at the service park between stages in the following areas: engine, gear box, brakes, steering and suspensions. You only have 30 minutes, so if your car is seriously messed up you will not be able to restore it to a 100% condition for the next stage. At the end of the round the total time for all stages is compared between racers and the first six positions in the standings get a number of points based on their performance (for example the fastest gets 10 points, 2nd place gets 6 points, and so on). Whoever has the most points after all the rounds becomes the new champion.In the track editor the track is represented by a single line or ribbon. You can edit the curves and change the inclines or declines of each track piece. The only restriction is that trackpieces cannot overlap, so for example you cannot make an 8-shaped track. When playing the track, scenery is added procedurally depending on the curves and inclines and which country is selected. The 84 default tracks make use of the same engine.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Twisted Metal 4</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-11-17</td><td>989 Studios</td><td>989 Studios</td><td>Racing / Driving</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade</td><td>Post-apocalyptic</td><td>Automobile, Vehicular combat</td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The fourth game in the Twisted Metal series!

Each monster has his own movement style, so you have to learn how they all move to stand a chance. One will move opposite of your movements, one will imitate you exactly etc.There are different modes in the game, such as training, in which you face just one monster of your choice and get used to his patterns; puzzle mode, which takes you through a series of rooms with different shapes and monsters; and battle mode, in which you are thrown into large rooms where all Oops Five members roam freely.Unlike its little brother Engacho! on the Wonderswan, this game is viewed from an isometric perspective while the other version is top-down.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Sanyō Pachinko Paradise 2: Umi Monogatari Special</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-11-18</td><td>Irem Software Engineering, Inc.</td><td>Irem Software Engineering, Inc.</td><td>Simulation</td><td>1st-person</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Pachinko Paradise 2 is the second title in Irem's long-running pachinko simulation series.

Playing the secret agent Ethan Hunt, the player has to fight international terrorists. Assisted by his IMF team, he sneaks into enemy bases, blows up ammunition depots, retrieves stolen information and takes out the terrorists.The plot is loosely based on the movie; Ethan Hunt is framed and has to prove his innocence which he is only able to do with the help of his good friends from the IMF team.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Charumera</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-11-25</td><td>Victor Interactive Software, Inc.</td><td>Bits Laboratory</td><td>Simulation</td><td>Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Managerial / business simulation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Charumera is a single-player Japanese video game released for the PlayStation in 1999.The game can be thought of as a management simulator of sorts, despite the fact that it actually stands on a genre of its own – at least considering the western market, where nothing of the sort comes to mind.You essentially take on the role of Uncle Charumera, the noodle mascot of Myojo Foods, as he goes through a city selling his goods (ramen), getting new ingredients and trying to please his customers as much as possible.Before getting into the game’s mechanics in a more detailed fashion, here’s a bit of interesting trivia: the word “charumera” is actually derived from the Portuguese “charamela”, a type of flute that was brought to Japan around 400 years ago. This flute has traditionally been used by yatai (ramen mobile food stalls, just like the one used in the game). So, there is an interesting double pun in the game’s title: it is both referring to the flute used by yatai/Uncle Charumera, and also to the mascot’s name itself.Right after starting the game, there is an option to name your stall, even though you can leave it at default value. Afterwards, you’re presented with what could be considered the “cooking” screen, where you can mash up all kinds of different ingredients to create distinct flavours of ramen. You start with only a select few ingredients, even though new ones can be acquired throughout the game.After you have your first couple of dishes lined up, it’s time to start selling. You control Uncle Charumera as he walks through town (from 3pm to 12am) accompanied by his stall, and the namesake flute is used to call upon potential clients. When you blow the flute, people – either a large crowd or a just a couple - gathers. The icons above their heads represent their thoughts concerning your dishes (whether they like or dislike it). It should be noted that their opinions can change over time, so it’s generally not a good idea to stick to one recipe just because it was successful in the past – some customers eventually get sick of the same recipe over and over again.Some customers have more refined tastes, and can be harder to please. However, if you do manage to persuade these clients, some of them can eventually become sponsors for your ramen brand.People can rate your dishes, and rating varies according to the area you’re in (e.g., a hit ramen recipe in one area can be disliked in another). 10 stars is the maximum evaluation you can get.
Probably the most complex aspect of the game is figuring out which ingredient combinations work best together – in fact, the key to this game is experimenting – in order for you to get the best rating possible.
There are lots of noodles, sauces, soups and seasonings that can be mixed up in dozens of different ways. Plus, the game does not have a time limit, so trial and error really has no punishment.There are a couple of other main characters besides Uncle Charumera:

 Kamikaze Jin, a taxi driver, which serves as your main “taster”, providing feedback and allowing you to check if you’re on the right track with a certain dish;
 Kumona, a temple priest which requires vegetarian ramen;
 Madame Iyan, the owner of a rival Chinese restaurant;
 Koishiya, owner of a Japanese soba shop.

You obviously earn money whenever you sell something – and even though the goal of the game should be making profit, it really does not seem necessary in order to proceed. There is no concept of finances/investment/accounting in the game, most likely to keep it simple and enjoyable, focusing solely on the creativity of recipe-making.On a more technical side, the game controls easily, with basic side-scrolling while walking around with Uncle Charumera, and simple d-pad transitions when selecting ingredients.
There is some background music throughout, and a few sound effects (flute, people’s bellies getting full, or people getting sick).
Visually, the game uses simple 2D graphics, with a couple of scenario variants (different parts of the city, daylight and night time).
There is also some degree of replayability, if only when considering the hundreds of ingredient combinations you can use to make your recipes.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Growlanser</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-11-25</td><td>Atlus Co., Ltd.</td><td>Career Soft</td><td>Role-playing (RPG), Strategy</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td>Real-time, Turn-based</td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Growlanser is a fantasy SRPG (strategy role-playing game), and the first in the Growlanser series of games.The main character is Carmaine, an orphan raised by the palace royal magician, Sandra.

However, throughout his childhood Carmaine experiences strange and vivid dreams of people and places he knows nothing about. When at last he becomes old enough, Sandra tells him it is time to go out and explore beyond the city gates. Accompanied by Tippi, his tiny fairy-like companion, he leaves the city to discover his destiny.The game has a complex storyline with branching paths. During his travels Carmaine will discover different lands and peoples. Among them are the Growsians, humans who can wield ancient magic, and the Featherians, a winged race of people. As the story progresses, Carmaine discovers that there are conspiratorial enemies seeking to cause trouble for the land and people.Carmaine's personality, stats and skills are determined by answering questions at the beginning of the game. Eventually other characters can join Carmine's party, some whose recruitment requires fulfilling certain conditions. Romance elements are possible with some party members.Combat between enemies and the large party of controllable characters is a mixture of real-time and turn-based styles. Strategic battles occupy the entire location; depending upon where the battle occurs, non-party members nearby (such as townspeople, soldiers etc.) may help the party by joining in.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">High School of Blitz</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-11-25</td><td>Media Works Inc.</td><td>Japan Media Programming Inc.</td><td>Adventure, Puzzle</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td>Comedy, Romance</td><td>Cards / tiles, Trading / collectible card, Visual novel</td><td>Contemporary, Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Setting</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">High School of Blitz is set in a contemporary high school setting with a twist— it's populated by a large variety of mythical creatures & entities.

Kururu gets entangled in a dispute between two families of witches, and must track down the pieces of a shattered gem.The battles follow a standard RPG battle system of enemies on the opposite side of the screen from the players and commands selected from a text menu.

After witnessing a customer at the store trying to sell his Medabot to the storekeeper, Ikki is engaged in a battle with the customer and receives a medal from the Phantom Renegade so he could confront the pesky salesman.Players will gain experience to level up their medals, as well as win new parts for their Medabots after winning battles.

The player character possesses statistics, which includes general attributes such as health and charisma,  as well as school subject-specific parameters (literature, arts, science, etc.). Beside those personal statistics, there are also indicators concerning the relationship the protagonist is having with one of the girls. The focus of the gameplay is to arrange the hero's statistics in such a way that the result will attract the girl. Statistics can be raised by dedicating time and effort to corresponding activities (such as attending literature class and reading in order to raise the literature parameter). The player character can also participate in various school club activities, which might affect his attraction level to different girls.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Missile Command</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-11-26</td><td>Atari Interactive, Inc.</td><td>Meyer Glass Interactive Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Defend cities around the world from an airborne alien attack.

Shoot their balloons with arrows or make a bunch of them lose their grip by hitting them with meat.  Time too many shots poorly and the wolves will inch their way up the tree towards you and the other pigs.  The higher they get, the higher of an area you're restricted to for aiming.Circus Charlie - Six games of timing, reflex and patience in one, each more difficult than the last.  Jump a lion through hoops and over flaming urns.  Hurdle over monkeys on a tight rope.  Bounce from trampoline to trampoline.  Roll and leap from ball to ball.  Avoid being knocked off your horse by jumping over or bouncing off of springboards.

Collect powerups like the roatating energy ball and the spiked ball.Roc 'N Rope - Cavemen and lizards impede your climb to reach the elusive Phoenix.  Your only tools are a rope and flashlight.  Throw your rope, climb up, and avoid your enemies or blind them with your flashlight.Yie Ar Kung-Fu - One of the granddaddies of one-on-one fighters.  Start with the giant Buchu, working your way up through the ranks against armed opponents using only your punches and kicks.  Each angle combined with either punch or kick provides a different attack.Scramble - Fly your rocket through enemy territory, avoiding enemy missiles or taking them down with your blasters or bombs.  If you run out of fuel, you're history, so remember to shoot the fuel tanks to refuel.Road Fighter - A high-speed top-down racer.  Pass other racers to increase your score.  Crashing results in fuel penalties.  Run into the multi-colored fuel cars or run the risk of running out of gas.Super Cobra - The speedy sequel to Scramble.  Pilot your helicopter through similar territory, once again taking out rockets and fuel tanks.  But now, you'll have to contend with turrets and other new enemies.Gyruss - Wave-based shmup in which you move your ship around the screen in a 360 degree loop.  Avoid the swooping enemies and their shots.  Grabbing the double shot increases your chances of survival.Time Pilot  Pilot your craft in every direction through borderless levels spread across time.  Biplanes, blimps, and more will try to take you out before you can eliminate them.  Catch parachuters for bonus points.Each game, originally mated with a vertical monitor in the arcade, has been shrunk to fit the horizontal display common to most homes.

Unlike in Vandal Hearts you and your enemies issue the commands at the same time and then move simultaneously. That results in completely new strategies and gives the game a unique touch.The story takes place in the already collapsed church state of Nirvadia, that was once formed by the religious leader St Nirvath, but eventually ceased to exist, because of several conflicts between unbelievers and local rulers.

It is also where a bitterly sarcastic sharp-eyed private investigator named Lewton tries to earn a living solving bizarre cases. A mysterious woman named Carlotta hires him to find her lost lover. Wandering through the dark city and gathering evidence, Lewton has to solve the case, confront a sinister conspiracy, and once again become torn between love and despair.Discworld Noir differs from other Discworld adventure games not only thanks to its more serious tone and much darker "film noir" atmosphere, but also because of its gameplay. Instead of inventory-based puzzles there are clues, which Lewton writes down in his notebook and which should be then used whenever there is a connection between the clue and the situation in question. Most of the gameplay is thus dedicated to detective work in conversations; but the usage of the right clues at the right place is still comparable to inventory-based puzzle-solving of other adventures.

This journey will take the player through six "worlds" based on nature, including Earth, Fire, Illusion, and Death, and pit them against monsters and bosses alike.Players control Ruus from a first-person perspective, swinging swords and casting spells accordingly.  Players can strafe with the left and right shoulder buttons.  Weapons and armor are found around the dungeon and equipped from the status screen.  Rings can be found that are imbued with a predetermined set of magic spells.  The player can have one ring on each hand, and one spell active for each ring.  Players can buy and sell items at shops. Equipment can wear out with repeated use, and must be repaired by a blacksmith or replaced all together.There are no experience levels in Shadow Tower.  Instead, the player builds stats by repeating related actions.  Players can find fixed warp and save stones within the world to travel and preserve their progress.  There are no maps, either in-game or included with the documentation, so the player must make their own with the help of an in-game compass.  The game supports multiplayer only through a limited 2-player battle mode.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Silhouette Mirage</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-12-01</td><td>SPAZ, Working Designs</td><td>Treasure Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other), Side view</td><td>Regional differences</td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Following genetic experiments conducted by a group of scientists at the turn of the millennium, a biological explosion contaminated the genetic structure of life on Earth. Two attributes emerged from the ruins, known as Silhouette and Mirage; like Yin and Yang, they cannot exist without each other, but are fundamentally opposed in their nature and ideology. Only a Messenger, one who contains both attributes in a balance, is able to get to the Edo facility and reverse back the genetic disaster, destroying both Silhouette and Mirage. This messenger is a young girl named Shyna Nera Shyna.Silhouette Mirage is a side-scrolling action game. The basic gameplay is somewhat similar to that of Gunstar Heroes. The game's standout feature is the concept of the two attributes. Depending on the enemy's attributes and the type of attack used by Shyna, damage can be increased, and spirit (equivalent to magic power) can be absorbed from enemies. Shyna can dash, jump, crouch, slide, and grab enemies, executing combo attacks. It is also possible to master moves, acquire money, and purchase special creatures called "parasites", which teach Shyna various types of attacks.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">BoomBots</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-12-02</td><td>SouthPeak Interactive LLC</td><td>Neverhood, Inc., The, DreamWorks Interactive L.L.C.</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td>Comedy</td><td>Fighting</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Some time ago - it could have been 1983 or 15 billion years -  alien cats invaded Earth, nabbed all of its house cats, and took off.

This entry deepens the elements of the European colonial expansion and colonial trade at that time such as signing contracts, exclusive trading ports, establishing trade routes, exploring and discovering treasure products etc. and they all reflect the special historical background of that era. Players choose from four different characters from four countries to begin their adventures, interacting with various characters giving the game a more RPG-like feel. Porto Estado simplifies the adventure and discovery aspect, with only a few major cities having monuments, and auto-navigation greatly increases the pace of the game. On the other hand ships, seamen and battles are more complicated and refined. To travel all over the world with confidence, players need to hire NPC sailors and put them into different post on the ship in order to make fully use of their abilities. A vessel physician can reduce disease consumption, a gunner can increase the hit ratio, and a captain can do hand-to-hand combat with captain of enemy fleet to avoid dangerous sea battles.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Daikōkai Jidai IV: Porto Estado (Shokai Genteiban)</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-12-02</td><td>KOEI Co., Ltd.</td><td></td><td>Special edition</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Besides a game copy of Daikōkai Jidai IV: Porto Estado, this Shokai Genteiban (Limited First Edition) also contains following items as well:

Set in an abandoned biochemical laboratory on an isolated island, the two player characters, Mitsuki and Rick, are part of an investigatory and cleansing force sent to find out the cause of an 'anomalous thermal reaction'. This game is a spin-off, set in the same universe as the arcade game Chaos Heat.Progress through the game is made by defeating enemies, which in this case are alien lifeforms and the laboratory's own automated defence system. An element of survival horror is introduced through the use of computer terminals, where the player can save and read files explaining the backstory of the game.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Check Mate</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000</td><td>Midas Interactive Entertainment Ltd.</td><td>Success Corp.</td><td>Strategy</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Chess</td><td></td><td></td><td>Point and select</td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Back of Jewel Case - PlayStation (UK) (from Ad Blurbs)Dozens of different options and visual guides make Checkmate the perfect way to improve your game.Choose from a range of difficulty settings as you attempt to beat the computer, or checkmate a friend in the two-player mode.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Chris Kamara's Street Soccer</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000</td><td>Midas Interactive Entertainment BV</td><td>Pixelstorm</td><td>Sports</td><td></td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Chris Kamara's Street Soccer is a five-a-side soccer game.It boasts twenty teams, a choice of pitch, and five game modes:

Exhibition: A single match where the player(s) select the sides
League: played with four, eight or sixteen teams
Cup Tournament: a four, eight or sixteen team knockout game
Time Attack: where the player wins if they score x goals within a time limit
Arcade: where there are power moves available
Penalty Shootout: here the game is decided by who scores the most penalties in a four shot shootout, if the game is tied then this will go to a sudden death mode.

Depending on the mode the player can alter the difficulty, the length of each half, and the strictness of the referee. There are twenty-five teams, five of which are locked at the start of the game. The teams are not licensed teams so the player selects a country's flag and gets a generic team, for example selecting Canada's flag brings up a Montreal team. 
The game starts with a dropped ball and from then on plays as any soccer game. The game auto-selects the player nearest the ball as the active player and their movement is controlled by the left joystick, kicking is controlled by CROSS - holding down CROSS triggers a power bar which adds pace to the shot. When a goal is scored the game restarts from a goal kick, goal kicks and throw-outs are the only time the player controls the keeper as all saving, or otherwise, is automatic.
The game does have a commentary, it is not the flowing naturalistic commentary that is found in some games rather it is a set of standard phrases such as 'Hard Tackle!", "What a Scorcher!", "Good Shot!" and "Go On, Shoot!", that are triggered by in-game actions. As well as the standard phrases the game also has a couple of unexpected ones like "What The Heck!" and "Punch Him!".</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Colony Wars III: Red Sun</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000</td><td>Midway Home Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Psygnosis Limited</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person, 3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td>Space flight</td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Red Sun is the third in Psygnosis'  Star Wars inspired "Colony Wars" saga.

The nonlinear action begins in a hub, which leads to the worlds, each with two to five levels. You can complete a level in one world, then move to another world, returning later to finish a new level in the first world. Developer Atari Games has delivered four new characters in addition to the four in the arcade version. Each character will have unique special attacks. Controller Pak support will allow players to team their evolving characters. Enemies, bosses, power-ups, music and sound effects are all getting radical makeovers. Atari is busily remapping carryover levels and cooking up devious new puzzles and hiding places for items, so don't even think of cribbing from the coin-op version. 
 
Graphical updates include real-time lighting, which is nowhere to be found in the arcade version. The N64 Expansion Pak pushes plenty of polygon-based enemies onto the screen. The essential action -- team up with others, find keys, magic, runes and other items, and beat the stuffing out of anyone in your way -- remains unchanged from the arcade hit. Atari has delivered a far meatier storyline, though, spiffed up by cinema cut-scenes at the successful conclusion of a world.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Goldie</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000</td><td>Midas Interactive Entertainment Ltd.</td><td>Code Monkeys Ltd., The</td><td>Puzzle</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Point and select</td><td></td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Back of Jewel Case - Playstation (EU) (from Ad Blurbs)Join Goldie the deer and friends in a search for her missing mother.

The investigation continues, but now the young people have to face real demons, and perhaps also the demons that live within their own hearts.Eternal Punishment is a direct sequel to  Persona 2: Innocent Sin. It can be considered its "mirror image", since its story deals with many of the same characters, but is told from a different perspective. The gameplay system is nearly identical to that of the previous chapter. The player navigates a party of up to five active combatants on a city map, accessing maze-like dungeons and fighting randomly appearing demons in round-based combat. Like in the predecessor, successful verbal communication with a demon grants the party Tarot cards, which can then be used in a Velvet Room to summon Personae and equip them on characters. The demon conversation system has been slightly simplified, with characters having less behavior modes when attempting to talk to a demon. The Personae-fusion interface has been streamlined, automatically lining up available characters. The rumor-spreading system from the previous game is featured as well, playing a somewhat more prominent role. A new spell registration service allows the player to teach Personae certain spells they were not equipped with. There are also more Personae to choose from in this installment.At a certain moment during the course of the plot the player is able to choose one of the two available characters to join the party, which branches the storyline for a short while. If the player completes the game two times with these two different paths, a secret dungeon becomes available for exploration.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Pipe Dreams 3D</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000</td><td>Empire Interactive Entertainment</td><td>Sick Puppies Studio</td><td>Puzzle</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Point and select</td><td>Real-time</td><td>Everyone</td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The planet Pipe was a peaceful place until one evil Pipe decided she was not happy.

After its launch into space, the station vanished, never to be seen again.Until now.The station has reappeared out of no-where, many years after its first launch, and is on a collision course with Earth. Two unlikely heroes (pilot and all-round ugly looking guy Dan and robot Evo) are now thrust with the mission to stop the station, and find out where it has been all this time.Sadly, not everything goes to plan, with their ship crashing into the station. Evo, the unlucky robot that he is, is thrown out of the ship and smashed into pieces. His only hope for survival is to attach his microchip into another host robot. Thankfully, underneath the wrecked ship is the remains of another robot, and with a quick fix Evo is now a robotic dog.As you enter the valley, you must contend with a host of other robots much like the dog, of all shapes and animal sizes. You can move Evo's chip from one animal to another to gain attributes and abilities, improving your chance of success to get past the killer penguins and rocket launching tigers.Aims of the game include the basic destruction of enemy robots, to sheep herding, controlling Evo the rat through a mini maze, and plenty more through 35 levels of insane 3rd person action.When the game was ported to PlayStation some of the bugs from the Nintendo 64 version were fixed.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Spec Ops: Stealth Patrol</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000</td><td>Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.</td><td>Runecraft Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Stealth Patrol is the first console adaptation of the long-running PC military Spec Ops series. Players command two rangers on a variety of missions. Instead of working with a squad like the PC versions, only two rangers can be controlled. This can be done by two human players working together. When there is only one player, the computer AI takes over the second ranger, but the player can switch between them at any time. Also different in this console adaptation is the change of gameplay perspective from first-person to third-person.Before starting a mission, players select the ranger best suited to complete objectives, based on five classes: machine gunner, grenadier, rifleman, close quarters specialist, or sniper. Each class has different abilities, and access to specific weapons or items. Each type also has a certain encumbrance, but the equipment can be further customized based on the available options. Some of the included weapons are shotguns, grenades, tripwire mines, machine guns and sniper rifles, but also more general items such as nightvision goggles.The missions are set in a forest in Siberia, snowy mountains in Bosnia, the desert in Iraq, mountains in North Korea, and the jungle in Vietnam. The radar is an important element during gameplay. When a ranger is shot at, the enemy position briefly lights up on the radar as a red dot. Killed enemies often leave behind medkits and additional item pick-ups such as ammunition.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Street Scooters</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000</td><td>Eon Digital Entertainment</td><td>TYO Entertainment Inc.</td><td>Racing / Driving</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Motorcycle</td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Back of Jewel Case - PlayStation (EU) (from Ad Blurbs)It's time to grab your Hawaiian shirt, slap on your headphones and mount your scooter as you embark on the fastest, craziest, most frenetic racer on two wheels!

The objectives vary, but central to them is collect the crates, build and arm a team of buddies and hunt down your enemies.Whilst the perspective is isometric, the world is fully modeled with physics especially visible in the vehicle control, from bikes to hover tanks, biplanes to jumpjets. Weapons special effects are also very varied, with homing missiles chasing their targets, bicycle pumps stunning and inflating, and chainguns with a recoil that sends a jumping buddy flying across the screen.Gameplay includes deathmatch games, domination and capture the flag variants and a hidden footie game (with exploding ball!). Many of the features are only unlocked after completing several levels. The multiplayer options runs up to four players in each of the different game variants, keeping to a steady 25fps with a split screen, under most conditions.AI control covers over twenty agents on a game level, all with different behaviors. Team member AI is controlled through a simple context dependent order button - select order whilst facing an enemy base and your buddies attack it, or whilst facing your base and they'll defend it. Occasional ambiguities over what the target of the order is can be resolved in 'binocular' mode, where the perspective is moved away from the player's buddy and a reticule snaps to the subject of the order.

It stars characters original to the series that were introduced in previous games, instead of the anime TV heroes that the main line games focus on. The game is set after the third Super Robot War and sees protagonist Masaki return to his homeland of La Gias, located on the inner surface of the hollow Earth. He finds the land engulfed in a civil war, and quickly decides to join the fight to restore peace. He soon learns that people from La Gias have opened gates to the surface, summoning robot pilots to join the war against their will, thus introducing both allies and enemies from the past wars into this new conflict. Among those summoned is Ryune, who, upon learning of the situation, decides to seek other summoned friends and help them before trying to return home. Unlike the straight science fiction scenario of the earlier games, EX goes for more of a fantasy flavor, with a medieval setting and a world of faeries, spirits, demons and magically-powered robots crossing with the hi-tech robots from the surface.The game consists of three separate campaigns plus a short training scenario: one for Masaki (easy difficulty), one for Ryune (medium difficulty) and one for a mysterious third character who was believed killed in the previous game (hard difficulty). Masaki's and Ryune's campaigns can be selected from the beginning, while the third one only unlocks upon completion of the earlier ones. All in all, the game includes more than 60 scenarios. While there are some branches in the mission tree, they are not as extensive as in the previous game. It is possible to import the results of one campaign into the beginning of another, leading to slightly different events.Gameplay is only slightly changed from the direct predecessor. Players control their units via context-sensitive menu commands on a top-down view of the area, with battles being fought via animated scenes. Changes include the ability to set counterattack strategy per enemy turn instead of globally, the introduction of ranged attacks that can be fired in the same turn after moving, dead zones for ranged attacks, and area attacks. Besides leveling up pilots and upgrading robots, individual weapons can now also be upgraded. The power statistic of pilots is gone, and special robot attacks now require high enough stats in both willpower and piloting skill. Control and UI improvements include the display of to hit chance before an attack, quick switching between units, the display of active spirit powers on pilots, several shortcuts, and diagonal cursor movement.Besides the usual assortment of Gundam, Mazinger and Getter Robo mechs, the game includes robots and characters from the series Goshogun and Dunbine, as well as a host of originals native to the La Gias scenario.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">The Adventures of Robin Lloyd</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-01-06</td><td>Gust Co., Ltd.</td><td>Gust Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td>Detective / mystery</td><td>Puzzle elements</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">PlayStation Store Description (from Ad Blurbs)To download content to the Memory Stick PRO Duo™ of your PSP® (PlayStation®Portable) system, the free space required is twice the size of the content to be downloaded.This software is playable for PLAYSTATION®3 and PSP® (PlayStation®Portable).To download this software, you must also have at least 90MB of free space on your PLAYSTATION®3 system's hard disk.To play this software with your PSP®, the latest system software and a Memory Stick Duo™ with at least 90MB of free space are required.For more detail information about download to your PSP® system, please see below URL.http://asia.playstation.comWhen downloading using PC:When downloading contents to PSP®, you must install the PLAYSTATION®Network Downloader application first.

The object is again to scale buildings while avoiding the falling objects thrown at you by its tenants, as well as windows that close on your fingers. The buildings themselves are laid out differently In the first stages, for example, the buildings start out as square skyscrapers. Later levels, however, require you to scale round ones. As well as this, new threats are introduced, such as:

Circling vultures that throw eggs at you.
Gorillas reaching out to grab you on both sides of the building.
Window cleaners that go from left to right, making you fall if you get in their way
Boulders thrown from elevators

Their stories are connected to each other, and each story occupies almost a lifetime: the characters grow up and die, new characters are born, etc. Saga Frontier 2 breaks with the non-linear approach of its predecessor by introducing a new event based scenario system, telling the stories in a more straightforward way, and limiting available characters and the places to visit. As typical for the series, stat upgrades and new abilities are gained directly in battle, and not by gaining experience points and levels like in most other RPGs. Magic spells are divided into six elements which may also be combined, and rely on items being equipped and the environment to draw the right Anima from. Hybrid techniques that combine weapon commands with spell elements also exist. Similar to Konami's Suikoden series, there are three types of combat: turn-based party combat, one-on-one (duel), and strategic army battles.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Dancing Stage Euromix</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-02-16</td><td>Konami Digital Entertainment GmbH</td><td>Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo, Inc.</td><td>Simulation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Music / rhythm</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The European version of Dance Dance Revolution.

Somewhere in the futuristic Hong-Kong, full of huge corporations, flying cars and helicopters, home for the famous Triad mafia, they have to find the young Wee Ming Lam, the daughter of a powerful gangster. But Hana and her partners don't suspect that the search for Wee Ming will lead them not only to very dangerous areas of Hong-Kong, but to outskirt villages infected by zombies, a dubious restaurant-brothel, and the Chinese hell, where they'll have to confront Yim Lau Wong himself - the Chinese equivalent of the Western Satan.The gameplay of Fear Effect is similar to survival horror titles such as Resident Evil, but it also features many pure action elements and arcade-like sequences, where precise timing matters. The player controls Hana, Glas, or (in a few instances) Deke during different chapters of the story. Player characters can crouch, sneak on enemies, and roll forward or to the sides. There are many human as well as monster enemies to eliminate or avoid. Characters can run and shoot at the same time, as well as use two weapons at once to combat multiple enemies. A considerable portion of the gameplay is dedicated to puzzle-solving.Instead of the traditional health bar characters have a "fear meter", which turns red and eventually kills the character whenever he or she is damaged or found in a particularly stressful situation. The functional difference between the fear meter and a regular health bar is the possibility to restore it to a normal green color by reducing the character's stress, e.g. solving a puzzle or killing an enemy in a stealthy way. The game's 3D character models are unshaded, aiming to resemble cel-shading technique and anime art. The backgrounds are pre-rendered and often consist of streaming or looping full-motion video. The story unfolds through numerous pre-rendered movies.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Guitar Freaks Append 2nd Mix</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-02-24</td><td>Konami Co., Ltd.</td><td>Konami Computer Entertainment Japan Co., Ltd. </td><td>DLC / Add-on</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This is a port of the arcade rhythm Guitar Freaks 2nd Mix, which is part of Konami's popular Bemani franchise.

Much like Tomb Raider, the game is viewed in a third-person perspective (i.e., behind your character's back). Adversaries include legions of foul, undead warriors, sentient hive-dwelling insects, and a nasty group of surly dwarves. Luckily, Drake is adept at both combat and magic, wielding an assortment of melee and ranged weapons, as well as several invaluable spells. Divided into five distinct realms, exploration is encouraged by the non-linear plot. Your character can advance in terms of experience and abilities, but this is more of a single-player adventure than a game of heavy role playing.

Roadster Trophy – The player starts by selecting one of the available racers and is given a sum of money that must be used to acquire a car. There are 3 divisions in which the player can compete on with the 3rd being of the easiest difficulty and requiring less money to participate;  the 1st being the most difficult one and needing a higher amount of money in order to participate.

The young student Kazuki Takemura works as a test pilot with Kirishima Industries, a production company of military battle wanzers (walking panzers), mechanized walking robots with movement similar to that of a human being. Kazuki has just finished testing the combat capabilities of the new Zeinslev prototype in the lab. Finishing his day's tasks he is asked by his best friend Ryogo to help with a company delivery to the Japanese Defense Force (JDF) military based. This simple choice determines where Kazuki is when strange things begin happening in Japan. A large explosion, a wanzer theft, his sister Alysia being hunted, rumors of a powerful weapon, and accusations of involvement by agents of both the OCU and the USN all make the situation more complicated. Kazuki is swept up in a plot of conflicting loyalties and attacked by various factions. He will need to recruit additional characters and wanzers in order to be victorious in battle and investigate leads to uncover what is going on.Front Mission 3, like other games in the Front Mission Series is a turn-based strategy game featuring real-time environments, CG movies, mechanized robots and strategic battles. The game contains two independent storylines with different situations, environments and unique characters made up of different set of allies and enemies. The majority of the game takes place on the battlefield where Kazuki and his allies are controlled in an overhead view 3D environment. The game is tactical and nature, so the player chooses his unit and assigns where it will be moved and what action it will perfom. Typical actions include attacking with a shoulder weapon (missiles or gernades), attacking with a weapon held in the hand (ranged and melee), using items, guarding against future attack and simply ending the turn. As chaarcters fire weapons back and forth at each other, they will inflict damage to different parts of the wanzer. Areas that can be damaged and destroyed/disabled include arms, legs, and body. Complete damage to the body will 'destroy' the wanzer in battle, whereas disabling other parts will merely render it less effective. Each weapon has a damage type which includes (I) "Impact", (F) "Flame" and (P) "Piercing". In practice these types function as weapon "elements" which can be reduced with the proper armor coating, however it usually renders it vulnerable to another damage type. Typically Anti-I defense is very weak against Class-P attack and defending against that is weak from Class-F and defending against that is weak from Class-I. Each weapon carried by the wanzers is also classified as either Ranged, Melee, Shield or Missile . Each pilot can have a proficiency in these skills, making the usage of some weapons by them more effective than others. Pilots also learn special skills during battle, these are activated by experience points, and amount of weapon usage. Special abilities are very dependent on the types of actions being performed and items equipped, so for example the ability "Double Shot" requires a weapon equipped in each hand of the same weapon class.Between combat missions, Kazuki is able to save his game as well as explore the "network". The network is a virtual internet, allowing connections to the (completely fictional) websites of organizations involved in the Front Mission 3 plot. While exploration on the network is not required, it's exploration will uncover clues to some of the game's backstory as well as open up the opportunity to develop email contacts, obtain additional funds and unlock new wanzer gear.Between certain missions, Kazuki will enter a town. These are represented by a simple graphical menu of different locations. Areas that can be visited typically include Pubs, Wanzer Equipment Shops, Wanzer Parts Shops and specific locations. Wanzers are mix-and-matchable so that feet from one model can be attached to another and different weapons carried. Different wanzer parts each have unique values for HP, accuracy, movement and armor. However each part and weapon has a "weight" value, which is determined by each individual Wanzer model's engine (as well as additional parts). A wanzer is always unable to carry more than it's maximum weight. Towns are also where Kazuki will often meet new characters and have conversations to uncover the plot.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Sammy Sosa High Heat Baseball 2001</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-03-21</td><td>3DO Company, The</td><td>Team .366</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Sammy Sosa High Heat Baseball 2001 is the third installment of the High Heat series from 3DO.

Tōya, an ordinary high school student, spends his time in school as always: sleeping during the class. After his detention, he went to the schoolyard with his friend Kōichirō. Suddenly, two robots come from the sky and battle it out, with one robot going down. Tōya gets slightly wounded, but manages to operate the fallen robot and defeats the enemy, albeit temporarily. He wakes up, two days later, in bed, completely confused whether or not the events were nothing but a dream. The scar he got from the previous battle is still on his face, leaving him wandering for any sort of reason. Suddenly, he feels weak, and after an encounter with a mysterious man, he is forced to sign a contract. The man tells Tōya the reason why strange thing happen to him: his consciousness no longer exists on Earth, and it now belongs to a different world. Tōya is then taken to a "gate", where our world and theirs meet. He is now left with the task of finding out what is going on, and eventually, find a way back to Earth.Seireiki Rayblade (pronounced as "rye-blade") is a turn-based tactical RPG in a very similar vein to Super Robot Wars/Taisen and Fire Emblem. The player controls pilots of robots throughout the entire campaign, battling against various types of enemies on an isometric field. All main characters possess powers that can give them a necessary edge in the battle. When enemy units are defeated, characters earn "prāna", their willpower. When prāna increases to a certain level, characters can perform more powerful attacks on the enemy.This game is actually a spiritual successor to the Masou Kishin: The Lord of Elemental, previously developed by Banpresto and Winky Soft. Banpresto went to develop the Super Robot Wars/Taisen franchise, while Winky Soft decided to make a game reminiscent of the original Masou Kishin. As such, the game shares many similarities with each other, including the combat, the gameplay, its mechanics, the science-fantasy setting, and even the design of the protagonist. However, the main story, while similar, plays out differently. Also, all combat in the game is performed on the playing field itself, i.e. it does not cut to a separate combat screen.

Unfortunately for Teisel the loan he took out to pay for the Gesellschaft just came due, and the two Bonne brothers are taken prisoner. Now it's up to Tron to save her siblings and pay off their debt the only way she knows how: Grand Larceny.Most of the levels in The Misadventures of Tron Bonne are played similarly to Mega Man Legends, but with minor tweaks to controls. Tron's walking tank, the Gustaff, can't equip the wide range of alternate weapons like Mega Man, but it can pick up and hurl large objects like trees and cars. It can also launch beacon bombs which direct the Servbots following Tron to either attack or steal anything in the vicinity. Additional levels include a crate stacking puzzle minigame where Tron needs to steal selected crates of valuables in a limited number of moves, and a first person dungeon exploration section where Tron must depend on the Servbots alone to clear out traps and enemies.

More precisely, this particular game is based on the second series and movie (1978).The time is 2201. It is one year after the Yamato successfully came back from the planet Iscandar. One day, earth receives a strange S.O.S. from deep space : the voice of a woman called Teresa, prisoner of the Comet Empire, warns Earth that the White Comet is on its way to the Solar System to enslave its inhabitants. But the Earth's Government doesn't want to believe her story. Fearing the upcoming danger, the crew of the Yamato reunites and decides to disobey their orders, eventually stealing their old ship (which was fated to become a museum) to rescue Teresa and stop the White Comet.The game itself is a real-time tactical game. It mostly plays on a board with hexagons where you must move your ship and fight against the enemy. You must manage the crew of the Yamato to gain advantage during battles and uses special options as the "Warp Jump" or the legendary "Wave Motion Canon". When two ships come on the same hexagon, a "space battle" begins where you control directly your ship in space.The game follows very closely the original story and features many animated cutscenes which are actually re-made scenes from the original anime - with 3D rendered space ships and new character design by Keisuke Masunaga. There are even two different endings following the story as told in the series or in the movie.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Shi-Kin-Joh</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-05-02</td><td>Sun Corporation</td><td>Scap Trust</td><td>Puzzle</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Shi-Kin-Joh ("Forbidden City") is a puzzle game similar to Sokoban in which the player must reach a goal by pushing oversized mahjong tiles which block the path.

However, five hundred years later Dan unexpectedly awakens in a Victorian museum in Kensington. A ghost named Winston tells him that the sorcerer Lord Palethorn has found Zarok's spell book, reanimating the dead as a result. The pages of the book have been scattered all over London, and it is the task of the valiant knight and his new companions to prevent the mad lord from collecting them and conquering the city.MediEvil II is an action game similar in concept and basic gameplay to its predecessor. The sequel is somewhat more linear than the first installment, having no world map and hence no possibility to choose the next level. As before, Dan relies on melee and ranged weapons to get rid of the enemies; however, the 19th century setting has replaced bows from the previous game with firearms such as pistols, shotguns, and portable gatling guns. A new feature allows the player to equip two weapons on the protagonist and switch between them quickly during combat. Dan also gains the ability to split his own head off, sending it to explore areas he cannot access with his whole body. While in this mode, Dan can solve puzzles and find hidden treasures, but becomes more vulnerable to enemy attacks. The sequel also adds a rotatable camera during exploration.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Mr. Driller</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-05-10</td><td>Namco Hometek Inc.</td><td>Namco Limited</td><td>Action, Puzzle</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Mr. Driller's world has been covered with mysterious blocks.

The gameplay is a combination of Tetris and Boulder Dash: You have to drill down through multi-colored blocks to reach the bottom while avoiding the consequences of reckless drilling; blocks left without a foundation will drop down after a while, potentially crushing Mr. Driller. As the hero's air supply is depleted with time, the player must regularly grab oxygen pick-ups. Some of the blocks are "X-Blocks", which take a few tries to drill through and take away a large chunk of the player's air if destroyed. If four or more X-Blocks come in contact with each other, they vanish and leave behind a small blue creature "Chisokojin", which grants 765 points when picked up. There are two scenarios in the game, the "2500ft" and "5000ft challenge" (called "500m" and "1000m" in the Japanese version), which are five and ten levels long respectively. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Élan Plus</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-05-11</td><td>Visco Corporation</td><td>Visco Corporation</td><td>Simulation</td><td>1st-person, 3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td>Life / social simulation</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Isometric</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">PlayStation Store Description (from Ad Blurbs)"elan plus" is a renewed version of "elan", a simulation game in which the player 's objective is to be chosen as a crew on a crew exploration vehicle heading to Planet Elan.

Ashley Riot is a Riskbreaker, an elite agent for the Valendia Knights of Peace (VKP) who is investigating some strange occurrences. A cult of religious fanatics known as Müllenkamp and their leader Sydney Losstarot have seized the manor of Duke Bardorba of Valendia Kingdom. The events at the manor have sent Ashley on a quest to get to the bottom of events, and travel into the catacombs that lead to the destroyed, yet magical city of Leá Monde. However Ashley is not the only person interested in the city, and other factions of the government, including parliament assigned Knights of the Crimson Blade and other VKP agents are pursuing their own agenda. Vagrant Story is a role-playing game with several distinguishing characteristics. The entire game (including the numerous cutscenes that advance the plot) is rendered in 3D. The game focuses on exploration of large, complex dungeon-like areas and combat; there are no "friendly" areas, NPC interaction, or monetary system. Dungeons contain many optional rooms and environmental puzzles that mostly involve pushing, destroying, and re-arranging different types of crates to access higher areas. Ashley can also jump and grab ledges of higher platforms during exploration.The game runs in real time, with visible enemies and no separate battle screens. When entering combat and attacking an enemy, the game is paused, allowing the player to choose targets and access the menu for other actions. A wireframe sphere displays the range of the currently selected weapon and detailed statistics on different body parts of the enemies within range.Ashley does not receive experience points from defeating regular enemies; he randomly gains bonuses to his attributes after defeating bosses, but in general the focus of the customization in the game is on weapons. Ashley can equip a wide variety of weapons and armor made out of different materials. Each weapon possesses, besides detailed damage statistics, parameters in one of the three categories (edged, blunt, and piercing), as well as affinity to any of the six enemy types encountered in the game. Damage in battle is calculated according to the weapon's and the enemy's particular strengths and weaknesses in any of these categories. Weapons used constantly against the same type of enemy improve in power against them. Each weapon can also be disassembled in workshops scattered throughout the game, and new weapons can be forged by combining blades with grips. Gems can be attached to some grips, usually increasing the weapon's affinity with an enemy category.Ashley can also make use of Magic, Chain Abilities and Break Arts. Magic is broken into four groups, namely defense, combat, healing and status. Chain Abilities allow Ashley to "chain together" consecutive hits against enemies. The player can assign various offensive and defensive effects to buttons that need to be pressed at the right time to execute a chain. These effects include inflicting status ailments on the enemy, reflecting damage, etc. Using chains, however, raises Ashley's Risk Meter, making his attacks less precise and himself more vulnerable. Break Arts are special skills learnt after repetitive use of a weapon type. Sacrificing some of the player's health, Break Arts can perform a high damage attack on an enemy.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Brigandine: Grand Edition</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-05-18</td><td>E3 Staff</td><td>Hearty Robin</td><td>Role-playing (RPG), Strategy</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Isometric</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Brigandine: Grand Edition is the updated version of the PSX game Brigandine: The Legend of Forsena.

The game features a land creation system, allowing the player to create new locations and story elements by placing mysterious artifacts.

Battle mechanics follow the traditional turn-based prototype, with a few additions such as critical attacks dependent on precise timing, and "dragoon" transformations, which allow access to powerful techniques.

A young gypsy woman named Koudelka, who possesses unique spiritual abilities, is off to Wales, to investigate the mystery of the Nameton monastery. This monastery was once a regular place of worship, but later was bought by a mysterious man whose death circumstances are yet unclear. Rumors say that supernatural powers have appeared in the monastery since then. But when she begins to explore the monastery, Koudelka discovers she was not the only one who was interested in its past... Koudelka is a role-playing game with elements of survival horror. Players take the role of Koudelka as she explores the monastery, gathering clues and solving puzzles. This aspect of the gameplay is therefore similar to a survival horror game; however, the combat is strategic and turn-based. During battles, players can position and move the party members freely on the battle field. The amount of actions that can performed during a turn depends on the dexterity of the character. There are also various support and attack spells to cast.The game features a refined weapon management, in which the damage that is inflicted with a particular kind of weapon (bare hands, guns, maces, etc.) increases the more that the weapon is used. Eventually weapons will break, but new ones can be found from defeated enemies. When one of the characters levels up, players can freely distribute experience points to increase and customize any of their statistics and parameters.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Pocket Digimon World</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-06-29</td><td>Bandai Co., Ltd.</td><td></td><td>Simulation</td><td>Side view, Text-based / Spreadsheet</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Managerial / business simulation, RPG elements</td><td></td><td></td><td>Menu structures</td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">A Museum was opened in the Digimon World.

The game features two game modes, which are Challenge and Free mode.In the challenge mode, players compete in a tournament where they are given three minutes to catch a fish large enough to meet the weight requirement, and this fish must also weigh enough to place within the top three of all the competitor fisherman's catches in order for the player to move on the next fishing area. The skilled fisherman who can complete the challenge mode, will be able to unlock new fishing lures and fishing areas.In the free mode, players are free to choose from four different fishing areas to practice in, with no competition or time limit to worry about. The fishing areas include fishing by the boathouse, fishing in a jungle setting, fishing by a waterfall which makes the water cloudy, and fishing while the sun is setting.When the player starts fishing, they must first choose a lure. Some of the lures include the minnow, popper, and pencil bait which each have their own characteristics.Once the line is cast, a lure action meter appears and the player has to fill it in order to attract the fish. Once the fish gets attracted and gets caught on the line, a line tension meter appears. The player has to be careful while reeling in the fish, to not let this meter fill, or else the line will snap and the fish will be lost. The player also gets to keep their 5 biggest catches alive in their aquarium.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Digimon World</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-07-01</td><td>Bandai America, Inc.</td><td>Flying Tiger Development</td><td>Action, Strategy</td><td>1st-person</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">You're a young boy who loved playing with the Digimon virtual pet with his friends after school.

From here on out, the player controls the young boy by moving him up, down, left or right, trying to find bug icons across the map.Once the character reaches one of these icons a certain mini-game ensues, which involves catching the bugs in several distinct fashions: using one of the boy’s hands to clap them against a tree, using both hands to trap them in, having another insect used as bait, using a net to catch flying insects passing by, among several others. Whenever you catch one, it is immediately put into storage, so you never lose insects once they are caught. Every time one of the mini-games is completed, the player will return to the world map and be able to check out information about the species he’s just caught. Also, a balloon will appear next to the icon representing the stage that was just completed, so the player can distinguish between finished and new stages.All the mini-games have a certain time limit, and if the depicted number of insects is not caught within that time frame, one of the available 3 attempts will be lost. When all 3 are gone, it’s game over.These mini-games comprise the majority of the game per se, and it is by finishing them off one by one that new ones are revealed (by having new bug icons appear on the world map), until all different species are collected. Even though there are 165 different species to collect, during each different trial the player will catch several insects of the same species, thus providing the game with more content by extending gameplay time.Speaking of gameplay, while some of the mini-games are quite feasible, others require a certain degree of luck, since in those you have a very limited field of vision (you can’t see the bugs before you execute the commands to catch them), essentially making your moves blind ones.The graphics are standard 2D PSX-era graphics, and while there is no music in the game, the sound effects play the role of a fully-fledged soundtrack – from cicada noise to water running down a stream, all sound effects manage to convey the feeling of being surrounded by nature.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Suzuki Bakuhatsu</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-07-06</td><td>Enix Corporation</td><td>Sol</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td>Puzzle elements</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Suzuki is having a very bad day.

Fortunately, she's also an expert at bomb disposal, so it's her job to make sure they're safely disarmed before they explode.Suzuki Bakuhatsu is a bomb disposal game where the player must disassemble and disarm increasingly complicated and bizarre explosives. Given a set of tools -- initially only a screwdriver and nipper; later also a wrench (spanner), allen wrench (hex key), and adhesive tape -- the player must disarm each bomb within a specific time limit. The player can rotate and look all around the object, looking for places to use different tools, but must always be mindful of the timer. If it runs out, the bomb explodes and it's game over. Additionally, there's no pausing once the timer starts, so think quickly!The game has three difficulty levels and more than a dozen different bombs to disarm. The story is told between each stage using live-action photographs.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">X-Men: Mutant Academy</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-07-06</td><td>Activision Publishing, Inc.</td><td>Paradox Development</td><td>Action</td><td></td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Fighting</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">X-Men: Mutant Academy is a fighting game featuring three-dimensional stages, but largely adhering to the rules of 2D fighters.

The game came to be for two main reasons; The lead singer of the band (Hyde) really loved the original game and the game served as good promotion for the band who were really popular at the time and had a new album in the works. The original game, as well as the band were both under Sony's roof at the time.The gameplay is very similar to the game's predecessor, keeping the on-foot racing with heavy emphasis on using the terrain to gain the upper hand over the opponent. The characters all run at a set speed, but using the left and right arm as well as well timed jumps on poles, springboards and hurdles will give the player a speed boost. If enough momentum is gained, the character leans forward and starts dashing at a much faster speed. Some areas will even allow the player to be airborne for a certain amount of time if the right path is chosen and if enough speed is gained. Hitting obstacles, getting punched by opponents or having any of the "weapon" items used against the player will slow their speed down significantly, sometimes even resulting in the character falling over in a stunned state.There are several modes in the game to choose from, including a single player tournament, two players versus each other and a series of tutorial levels where the player can practice the basics of the game (if a player fails enough times in any of the tournament levels, she/he is sent to the appropriate tutorial as a "punishment" as well).The game is mostly cosmetically different from the original, and instead of the original characters the four band members have taken their place initially. Several of the original characters can be unlocked later through various means, such as beating them in races, completing certain objectives etc.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">The Tetris</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-07-19</td><td>Success Corp.</td><td></td><td>Action, Puzzle</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Falling block puzzle</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The Tetris is an officially licensed Tetris game that is part of the SuperLite 1500 budget series. This version consists of a single player mode and a multiplayer mode for two players. The singleplayer mode works like any other version of Tetris with the aim being to direct blocks down a well with the goal of creating and removing lines down the bottom of the well. The player then scores points and for every few lines removed the game's level increasing which leads to blocks falling at a higher pace. Before playing it's possible to choose a starting level. The multiplayer mode is for two human players only with no AI opponent being available. It works just like the singleplayer game but with one difference. When a player removes multiple lines at once, garbage blocks are sent over to the opponent whose stack then will rise. The player that survives the longest will win the match. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Kinniku Banzuke: Road to Sasuke</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-07-24</td><td>Konami Co., Ltd.</td><td>Konami Co., Ltd.</td><td>Simulation, Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Cinematic camera</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Sasuke (also known as Ninja Warrior outside of Japan) is an annual sports TV show where 100 competitors compete each year in 4 obstacle courses. The courses require both agility and strength and are increasing in difficulty. Courses do not dramatically change every year and are basically the same, although there are some alterations in parts of them every now and then.The game lets you do the training on each of the courses with some of the pre-defined characters, or you can create your own character and enter the full competition. Sasuke is a sport where failure is not an option. No matter how far you've come, if you either make a mistake and fall into the water that is at the bottom of each of the first three courses, or run out of time, you lose and get disqualified. As courses are gradually increasing difficulty, in real life after the first course only a handful out of a 100 competitors remain to try the second course and so on. Sometimes none of the competitors even reaches the last course, and even rarely finishes it all.Gameplay-wise, it's a button mashing game where you press specific button or repeat a button sequence in order to make your character run with occasional pause when you need to jump or perform a more unique action specific to the course. The first course is less muscle and more agility, meaning you'll have to run and jump a lot to make it in time to the end. Some of the obstacles consist of jumping over bodies of water, holding onto the rolling tree log without falling down, rope climbing, or balance walking. Second stage is more muscle focused and will require you to hold onto something or to lift heavy objects. Third stage tests your limits by having very few places to stand and rest, and you have to pass most of it by holding onto something or your body weight with just young fingertips. The final stage is direct rope climbing where you have to climb 15 meters high in 30 seconds flat. The game also features real-life commentators, Tsutomu Taruki (垂木 勉) and Ichirou Furutachi (伊知朗 古館).</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">NCAA Football 2001</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-07-25</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Sennari Interactive, LLC</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">NCAA Football 2001 is a continuation of EA Sports' NCAA Football series.

Suddenly, real ghosts appear and scare the teenagers away. The next day, Yuri is almost ready to believe it was all a dream... but naturally it wasn't. The dark secrets of the lost souls are going to be revealed only to those which possess a special sense - the Twilight Syndrome..The third entry in the  Twilight Syndrome series is also a horror adventure, sharing most gameplay elements with its predecessors. The gameplay here is very minimalistic: the player can navigate the 3D models of the heroes (several characters can be controlled at once, as a group) through the limited areas (also rendered in 3D), searching for clues and escaping from danger. There is no other interaction, no usable items, and no combat. Dialogue and action choices will pop out during many situations. Some of these choices do not influence the narrative, while others might change the following dialogue, and also lead the young heroes to premature death.An additional gameplay mode (beside the story mode) is free-roaming exploration for Yuri, who can explore the school and its surroundings at night and gather more stories from the ghosts she encounters.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Winning Lure</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-07-27</td><td>Hori Electric Co., Ltd.</td><td>Hori Electric Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action, Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other), Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">PlayStation Store Description (from Ad Blurbs)Enjoy the fun of Lure Fishing in “WINNING LURE”.

It includes 32 nations, going for gold in 12 events divided by 6 sports: Athletics (100m dash, 110m hurdles, hammer and javelin throw, triple jump and high jump), Aquatics (200m freestyle and 10m platform diving), Kayak K1 Slalom, Super Heavyweight Weight Lifting, Skeet Shooting and Three-man track cycling pursuit. All events feature 3D graphics with cameras that mimic the ones used in TV broadcasts.Gameplay is the usual found in games of the genre - button mashing the two power buttons is required in most events to build up strength/speed, with an additional third button setting the actions, such as jumping or throwing angle. Other events feature alternate control methods, such as Slalom (where it's possible to press certain buttons to dodge the rower between the gates if the Kayak is going to hit one or place the paddle to force into a certain direction),  Diving (following a "click-along" sequence of keys) and Skeet (the direction keys controlling the aim, one button to start and other to shoot).Along an arcade and 8-player action, the Olympic mode gives the player the option to build their athlete from the national open trials to the Olympics. By completing training drills in the Cyber Gym, the athlete increases his athletic abilities: Citius, Altius, Fortius, as told by the Olympic Motto. Before joining the competition, the player must beat national, continental and international opponents.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Monster Rancher Battle Card Episode II</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-08-02</td><td>Tecmo, Inc.</td><td>Tecmo, Ltd.</td><td>Strategy</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td>Cards / tiles, Trading / collectible card</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Monster Rancher Battle Card Episode II is the sequel to Monster Rancher Battle Card GB. But it takes advantage of the PlayStation's superiority in graphics and processing power and adds more complex storyline quests, and expands the card game itself. No knowledge of other Monster Rancher games is needed, however, characters from prior games do play pivotal roles in the storyline. For the first time, players can see into the personal lives of the characters in the Monster Rancher world, and interact with them while attempting to win matches of the collectible card game, to collect enough cards to complete quests. Along the way, the player is able to visit various locales and meet up with old friends and new acquaintances.The card game itself features a  tutorial mode, on screen help, and the option to turn animations on or off. It is easy enough at low levels for almost anyone to learn the basics, but offers options and higher levels of complexity to reward more patient, and older players.Cards are acquired through defeating opponents, and via an in-game shrine where you can use music CDs, PlayStation games, or PC CD-ROMs to make cards. The CD shrining feature is unique to the Monster Rancher games.The game also features a 2P mode designed for players who have played the game on their own and acquired their own cards (and tried and tested their skills) to play card games against each other. It is adequate, but unrelated to the in-game storyline.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-08-03</td><td>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Acclaim Studios Salt Lake City</td><td>Racing / Driving, Sports</td><td>Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Motorcycle, Off-roading</td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This edition of the licensed Supercross racing game features

One day, while strolling on the sea shore with his sweetheart, Serge suddenly disappears. He comes back to senses several moments later. Everything seems just the same as it was before, but when Serge visits his home village, nobody recognizes him. He hears from people that he has been dead for ten years. Serge begins to realize that he is now in a parallel world. His first and only wish is to find a way to return home, but, in order to do that, he must understand what has caused the existence of parallel words, allowing inter-dimensional travel. His quest will also reveal to him the truth about his own existence.Chrono Cross is a Japanese-style role-playing game, and a sequel to Chrono Trigger. The game's story is not directly connected to that of its predecessor, though there are sub-plots and characters that refer to it. Combat in the game is turn-based; like Chrono Trigger, the game has no random battles, and enemies are always visible on screen. During battles, Serge and his party members can perform three kinds of attacks: weak, medium, and strong, which tend to miss more frequently but inflict more damage. Actions in battle deplete a certain amount of stamina, which recovers as other characters act. There are also no character levels in the game: instead, the characters get their parameters increased directly after each battle. All magic spells, character-specific tech attacks, and consumable items are grouped into six elements, which are divided into three pairs with opposing properties. Each player-controlled character and enemy has an innate element, which enhances the power of spells categorized under it when used by said character, but also weakens his or her resistance to the opposing element. Battle fields may also be marked by a particular element, granting bonuses to attacks based on it, and reducing the damage caused by the opposing one. Player-controlled characters have differently shaped grids which allow the player to allocate purchased or found elements there. When the character participates in a battle, the allocated elements act as equipped spells, and can be cast until their amount is depleted.Though most of the plot progression is linear, there are several sub-quests that are not required to complete in order to reach the game's ending. The game features many recruitable characters (up to 45, though not all of them can be recruited in one playthrough), several different endings, and the ability to play the game again with the statistics and items from the previous play.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Madden NFL 2001</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-08-15</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>EA Tiburon</td><td>Sports</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Madden NFL 2001 is another yearly update in the long-running football series. The version for PlayStation and Nintendo 64 comes with its own selection of teams, modes and options, refined from the previous year's iteration. Compared to other versions, it has the largest number of modes, but less graphical fidelity and a lower number of selectable teams.Players can select from the 31 teams of the 2000 NFL season and the 1999 All-Madden team on both consoles. The PlayStation version adds 31 All-Time franchise teams and 101 Classic NFL teams, from 1960 to 1999. Available modes include exhibition games, season, franchise, custom league (four to eight players), tournament (for 4, 8 or 16 players in single or double elimination), practice, and situation (set up any possible game situation to play). A new addition is called Two-Minute Drill: up to ten players compete for points by trying to perform spectacular plays within a two-minute time limit. Exclusive to the PlayStation version is the Great Games mode, allowing players to relive classic matchups from NFL history. The Great Games must be taken on in order and winning one makes the involved teams available for selection in other modes. As usual, player creation, drafting and trading as well as custom play creation is included in the game as well.The previous year's Madden Challenge reappears in a new form called Madden Cards, resembling a collectible card game. The game includes a list of 100 challenges organized in five different levels. These include making certain plays or play combinations, beating teams under certain conditions (e.g. at home and in the rain), avoiding fumbles, sacks and penalties, et cetera. Completing a challenge gains the player tokens (how many depends on the difficulty level played at) which can be spent to buy a number of randomized Madden Cards. There are a total of 296 cards in the game (differing in rarity) which are collected in the in-game card book. Unwanted cards can be sold to regain half the tokens paid. It is also possible to trade cards with other player profiles and it is even possible to wager cards in two-player games. The cards have a number of different effects: most unlock classic players as well as hidden teams and stadiums. Others can be activated for different gameplay effects: making the game harder or easier or enabling gags such as teleporting players or putting the camera inside the ball.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Tenchu 2: Birth of the Stealth Assassins</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-08-15</td><td>Activision Publishing, Inc.</td><td>Acquire Corp.</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td>Stealth</td><td>Fantasy, Japan (Ancient/Classical/Medieval)</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Tenchu 2 is a prequel to Tenchu, telling a tale of events prior to those of the previous game.Once again, you can play as Ayame or Rikimaru, two faithful and honorable ninja whose lord is a gentle man in an age of warfare. With your training nearly complete, you find yourself caught up in aiding your lord against a civil war in his own domain. All is not what it seems, however, and you'll soon realize that your greatest threat has been forged much like you. Much like its predecessor, Tenchu 2 is a 3D third person stealth action game. You are not only rewarded for stealth, but also for efficiency of movement this time. This extra feature increases the difficulty of achieving the better items, as you not only have to be quiet, but be direct and near perfect in your steps. This time around, the stories of the two ninja (and the hidden third character) diverge greatly at places. In addition, cutscenes using both the game engine and CGI give more story as you progress. In addition to the story mode, there is a mission editor, which allows you to create maps and missions to both hone your skills and share.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">ECW Anarchy Rulz</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-08-16</td><td>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Acclaim Studios Salt Lake City</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In this rendition of ECW, or Extreme Championship Wrestling, there are 32 wrestlers to choose from and even more options.

Total-control passing lets you lead, overthrow, and underthrow your receivers so that you can throw more completions and prevent defenders from intercepting your passes.  The play editor has been improved making it easier to make new patterns for your receivers and running backs. The general manager mode has also been changed, mostly to help you with the draft so you can easily see what areas of your team need improvement.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">LEGO Rock Raiders</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-08-17</td><td>LEGO Media International, Inc.</td><td>Data Design Interactive Ltd</td><td>Action</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Back of Jewel Case - PlayStation (US) (from Ad Blurbs)Stranded in orbit around an uncharted planet...

The game includes three different terrain types (forest, desert and ice) with four tracks each. There are Amateur and Pro Championships for every terrain type, with Amateur and Pro tracks differing slightly. The Amateur trophy has to be won to unlock the respective Pro circuit. Players can select from six different riders and at the start there are two quads per terrain available to choose from. Winning each Amateur circuit unlocks two more per terrain and winning everything unlocks the best quad in the game.Gameplay is seen from either 3rd (behind the quad) or 1st person perspectives and players can select from manual or automatic transmission. The quad and the rider are controlled independently from each other: the right analog stick steers the quad while the left stick is used for leaning the rider, which is important while cornering: incorrect leaning can lead to the rider being thrown off, losing valuable time.Besides the Championship mode, there are Single Race, Time Trial and Two-Player modes. Tracks and quads to be used in those modes have to be unlocked via winning Championship races first.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Dragstars</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-08-24</td><td>Success Corporation</td><td>JAM Co., Ltd. </td><td>Racing / Driving</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Automobile, Street racing</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Back of Jewel Case - PlayStation (UK) (from Ad Blurbs)Dragstars puts you in the driving seat of

Spider-Man must work to clear his name and uncover the sinister motives behind the device's theft.This game features appearances not only by most major Spider-Man characters, but cameos by numerous other characters from the Marvel Universe, such as the Human Torch, Punisher, Daredevil and Captain America.Spider-Man's webs are greatly emphasized.  He can use them both for navigational purposes, like swinging or ziplining, and for offensive and defensive combat, such as tying up a villain, coating his fists with web for extra oomph, or building a protective shield.  His web supply is limited though and he must find new cartridges or risk running out.  The wall-crawling powers are also prominently features.  Spider-Man can cling to any wall or ceiling.  This is used for basic environmental navigation and for stealth as there are many sequences where you crawl over the heads of unsuspecting thugs, or drop down and catch them off-guard.Combat is based around Spider-Man's ability to jump, kick, punch and web.  By combining these with direction and in various combinations, Spider-Man is able to throw objects such as furniture, hurl web balls, yank enemies into melee range and follow up with a flurry of hits, among other things.  There are a number of boss-battles as well, all of which are puzzle-based.Missions vary from the fairly common fight-your way-to-the-goal or find-the-key-that-unlocks-the-door types to races to catch some or evade them or just trying to avoid the police.There are several side goals in addition to the main mission including multiple unlockable Spider-Man costumes and numerous hidden comic book covers to find.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Yūkyū Kumikyoku: All Star Project</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-08-24</td><td>Media Works Inc.</td><td>Starlight Marry Corporation</td><td>Adventure</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Yūkyū Kumikyoku (Eternal Suite) is the final title in the Yūkyū Gensōkyoku series, and is once again a traditional Japanese adventure game.

The player controls Lenneth, gathering soldiers and training them to be transferred to the battlefields of the gods.The gameplay mainly consists of exploring various locations (dungeons, mansions, swamps) from a 2D perspective. Lenneth can run, jump, shoot ice crystals (useful for anything from freezing enemies to building ledges), push and pull objects to solve simple puzzles, etc. All of the enemies are on-screen and can usually be avoided, in the style of games like Chrono Cross and SaGaFrontier 2. The battle system is turn-based. Each of the characters (up to three can fight alongside Lenneth at a time) is assigned to one of the four main keys. The player and the enemy take turns attacking, but with the right timing, the player can execute combos that leave enemies defenseless. Long combos can result in substantial experience bonuses, although it is possible to defeat most enemies without them.The rest of the game consists of Lenneth using "spiritual concentration" to discover the locations of dungeons and fallen heroes, ingame-engine cutscenes that give the history of these characters, and reports about the war's progress that come at the end of each "chapter". The chapter system is one of the game's most original features. Each chapter (there are about 8) is made up of a preset number of periods. Each action, such as a successful use of spiritual concentration, or entering a town/dungeon, uses a number of periods that varies with the difficulty level. When all of the periods have passed, the chapter is over. The player must transfer heroes to Valhalla in the course of each chapter (permanently losing them), but has only a limited amount of time to improve their statistics.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Happy Salvage</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-08-31</td><td>Media Works Inc.</td><td>Media Works Inc.</td><td>Adventure</td><td>1st-person, Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Japanese-style adventure</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling, Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Happy Salvage is a treasure hunting romantic adventure game that uses 3rd-person perspective for exploring places and diving underwater to collect treasure, with visual novel style 1st-person perspective during dialogues featuring anime characters over static backgrounds.

Like its predecessor, it is an unconventional soccer game where instead of a complete team, only a single player is directly controlled, with the other 10 players being controlled by the AI, although with the option to influence their choice in plays. However, unlike the original title, Liberogrande International is a home console title, and along featuring a more realistic visual presentation, it's now possible to choose formation and pick any player (including goalkeeper and the title-mentioned libero) to control, instead of being limited to play as either right-wing or playmaker, depending on the predefined team formation.Gameplay remains mostly unchanged; the camera follows the ball, circling around the controlled player. When the player is carrying the ball, he can do the usual actions (pass, shoot, cross, throw a long pass), while keeping an eye on other players asking the ball and running into space. With possession but without the ball the player can ask for either a low or an high pass. Without the ball, the player can either tackle or instruct other players when to attack the ball, if this option is enabled. At the end of the match, the player can see how well he performed, along a "heat map" on his positioning.Since all players are now given equal billing, the player can now edit all 32 national team players' names, as well as creating his own superstar (which can be used on any national team). Game modes include exhibition (where you can play with or against a friend in split-screen mode), LiberoGrande Cup (straight elimination cup), International Cup (World Cup style tournament) and World League.Unlike the Japanese version, the European one doesn't feature commentary.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Paca Paca Passion Special</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-09-07</td><td>CyberFront Corporation</td><td>Produce Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td>Music / rhythm</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">PlayStation Store Description (from Ad Blurbs)★This game is supported with the PSP® and PS Vita screenshot function★PSP®: Screenshots can be taken by using the menu after holding the PS button (HOME button) in the game.

The missions that are similar (usually those taken from the film) further tend to play out differently, and utilize completely different gadgets and weaponry. This version does not feature additional objectives at higher difficulty modes, and only cheats are unlocked by beating specific missions at a specific difficulty. However, it does feature CD-quality music and voices, as well as video clips from the movie for cutscenes.

Instead of digressing into several leagues, Stars focused on only one (giving each team individual kits and stadiums) and allows the player to  improve his team by enhancing the players' abilities or in the transfer market. However, to do so, first the player has to win Star Points on the playing field - by scoring, not losing and having a clean sheet in both goals against and sending offs. Occasionally, there might be some Stars Challenges, which require the player to fulfill a task (scoring five goals, for instance), which will grant more star points, at the risk of possibly losing them if the requirements are not met.After the player completes a season (which includes the league, cup, European cup, international cup and legends match, against an all-time squad), the player can save the team, customize it and then play against other human-controlled custom team, the winner being able to select (well, steal) key players from the opposing team.Commentary is provided by Richard Keys, Martin Tyler, Clive Tydesley and Andy Gray.

Single-player gameplay consists of a tournament mode, in which the player selects a tank and takes it through a series of combat matches. The game's focus, however, is on the multiplayer, which includes different modes: deathmatch, capture-the-flag, frenzy, (a capture-the-flag variant with randomly appearing flags), as well as a so-called "domination mode", in which players must capture several tank generators scattered across the arena. Up to four players can compete in each of the multiplayer modes. Various power-ups can be picked up on the arenas.

However, the teams features are not entirely based on real life (Indy was at the top), and it is not as addictive as the old-fashioned PC games of the early 1990's, but still a good game for someone who doesn't mind not-so-classic, almost XFL style football.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Simple 1500 Series: Vol.37 - The Picture &amp; Slide Puzzle</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-09-14</td><td>D3Publisher Inc.</td><td>Earthly Production, Inc.</td><td>Puzzle</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">PlayStation Store Description (from Ad Blurbs)This title includes illustration puzzle and slide puzzle, the golden combination of brain-twister puzzles!Illustration puzzle includes a total of 500 monochrome and colour puzzles, as well as 100 slide puzzles.Paint, remove and marking actions are all easy to control.Two-play battle is available for slide puzzle.9 pieces to 25 pieces are included.

Rayman has been captured by the pirates as well and is lamenting his troubles in his prison cell when he meets his good friend, Globox.  Globox has smuggled in a silver Lum, given to him by the great fairy, Ly.  With the power of the silver Lum, Rayman is able to once more shoot his fists.  With his power restored, the pair escape the flying prison ship and embark on another adventure to save the entire world!Rayman 2: The Great Escape is the sequel to Rayman, a 2D side-scrolling platform game.  Unlike the previous game, Rayman 2 is entirely in free-roaming 3D environments, similar to Super Mario 64.  Rayman has many unique abilities that can help him get around the world.  In addition to being able to shoot his fists, he can use his hair to hover like a helicopter, and even glide on air currents in certain places.  He can climb certain walls and ceilings and can even use his fists to swing from special purple Lums which are shaped like rings.  Rayman also has many unique items at his disposal, such as powder kegs which can be carried or fly like jets, strange warheads with legs that he can ride and steer like bucking mules, and gigantic plums that can be thrown into the water to create new paths.Rayman's goal is to find the four masks of the world, which allow the owner to reawaken Polokus, the spirit of the world.  These masks are scattered far and wide, and are well hidden and guarded, so it is not an easy task.  By gathering the yellow Lums, Rayman will gain access to new worlds, which will take him to the locations of new masks.  Collecting yellow Lums also rewards him with new powers and life meter extensions.The Nintendo 64 and Windows platforms are the original versions of the game. The Nintendo DS version sticks closest to this version.The Dreamcast version adds a new area to the original version called Globox Village which contains exclusive mini-games. The mini-games are unlocked by collecting six hidden Globox crystals. Also, other changes include The Hall of Doors being changed into a new place called The Isle of Doors and more Robo-Pirates to contend with, including a new type not seen in the original version. The iOS and Nintendo 3DS versions are based on this version but don't include the Globox Village section. However, the 3DS version features a dynamic difficulty curve, with the game getting easier if too many lums are missed.The PlayStation version features a heavy alteration of the levels with some being merged and some being removed altogether, although there are also some new areas as well. This includes a new unlockable bonus area that was from the originally planned 2D version of the game that was scrapped. The amount of collectible Lums was reduced from 1,000 to 800. In this version characters are also voiced with actual real languages instead of the whisper speak of the other versions. The PlayStation 2 version adds minigames, exclusive items like the Lumz Radar, and offers more abilities for Rayman to purchase and use.
Along with some expanded level revisions with lums being placed in different locations, there are three new bosses to contend with. The Hall of Doors has become hub locations, The Minisaurus Plain, Globox's House, and The Rainbow Creek. Bonus challenges can also be played by freeing caged Familiar Spirits. These prisoners are exclusive to this version of the game. The game also gives the option to use either the real language voice-overs or the older version's style and lets players save mid-level.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">The Flintstones: Bedrock Bowling</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-09-19</td><td>SouthPeak Interactive LLC</td><td>Adrenalin Interactive, Inc.</td><td>Action, Racing / Driving, Sports</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td>Prehistoric</td><td></td><td>Jason Lewis</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In The Flintstones: Bedrock Bowling, Fred Flintstone is toiling away as usual at his thankless construction job.

The biggest dilemma for Fred is that he needs to practice for an upcoming bowling tournament. The benevolent alien named The Great Gazoo materializes and solves the problem by digging a trench and lining it with giant bowling pins. He then gives Fred a large bowling ball half shell in which to play live action bowling.The action in Bedrock Bowling takes the form of steering the bowling shell down 8 different lanes. Each lane has 10 pins that the player must try to hit. Additionally, there are many diamonds, birds, and other powerups along the way to be collected for points.The 8 lanes are Gravel Factory, Quarry, Flooded, Tar, Freeway, Crystal Mine, Lava, and Rockzilla.

A military unit is sent to the past to save the survivors and retrieve the research data. But nearly all soldiers are massacred by dinosaurs. You take control of Regina and Dylan, who managed to escape this fate. Now you must find the survivors, retrieve the data, and get back to your own time. Dino Crisis 2 is a survival horror game in which you control the characters Dylan and Regina (switching from one to another at various points in the storyline). You will collect items and use them to solve puzzles while fighting the hordes of dinosaurs that inhabit the island. Much like Alone in the Dark, the game uses 3D models for characters, enemies and items and static 2D backgrounds for their surroundings. Initially, each character starts with a gun and a melee weapon, but more weapons, such as flamethrowers or rocket launchers, can be bought later in the game. The dinosaurs' attacks cause you to lose "vitality", which can be restored using healing items. Sometimes an attack will cause you to bleed and thus slowly lose health; specific health items stop the bleeding. For each killed dinosaur you receive "Extinction Points". By killing a couple of dinos in quick succession, you activate a 'combo' and thus get more points. The points can be used in "Save Shops" throughout the game to buy weapons, ammo (and cartridge upgrades which allow you to store more ammo within the weapon), healing items and "tools" (such as armor, more powerful melee weapons, or "cards" which allow you to get bigger combos). You can also save the game at these points.

You play as D, the half-human / half-vampire whose sole mission in life is to hunt down and kill vampires.  The setting is not the distant medieval past, nor is it the mid-19th century, instead D's adventures are set in the far distant future, when humanity has nearly killed itself off by endless wars.  Rising from the scorched earth and assuming power in this desolate era are the timeless vampires.  They established a feudal system where they ruled over humans as nobles in Europe ruled over their peasants.  But after thousands of years the Vampires' power waned and humans revolted against their lords, and thus the class of Vampire Hunters were born.In this particular story, D is employed by a rich family to retrieve their daughter from the vampire who kidnapped her.  He is not the only one trying to free her; a rival group of vampire hunters, the Marcus Brothers, are after the daughter and the bounty, regarding D as a rival.  The Vampire Hunter D must enter Castle Chaith, battle the Vampire Lord, the minions that inhabit the castle, and a hidden evil, to save the girl and collect his bounty.The action in Vampire Hunter D plays like the early Resident Evil games.  There are pre-rendered backgrounds and all the characters are animated in 3D.  Players utilize D's signature weapon, his massive long sword, as well as his special vampire powers, (which comprise healing, offensive, and defensive powers), to battle the hordes of evil creatures that live in the hallways and chambers of the daemonic Castle Chaith.  You must solve puzzles, unlock doors, and retrieve key items to progress into the depths and heights of the castle, ultimately reaching and revealing the true evil power pulling the strings of this macabre story.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Freestyle Motocross: McGrath vs Pastrana</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-10-02</td><td>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Z-Axis, Ltd.</td><td>Racing / Driving, Simulation, Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Tricks / stunts</td><td></td><td>Motorcycle</td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Freestyle Motocross offers a chance to play as two Supercross greats.

The game shifts back and forth as the player must follow each of the protagonist's individual quests, which ultimately intertwine in a struggle between gods and humans.One of the game's innovative concepts consists on keeping track of each of the party member's will towards the protagonists. The protagonists may be hated or liked, and trusted or mistrusted by each of the characters they constantly interact with. Such relations change based on choices the player performs, and based on his actions during battles (letting a character die, for instance, would make him trust the player less). The relationships between each character also have an influence on each one's growth, allowing different spells to be learnt, for instance.Battles are by default carried automatically by the computer, and the player may only interfere by selecting a primary enemy target, commanding spell casting or changing between offensive and defensive behavior.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Shinobi no Roku</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-10-05</td><td>Astec 21</td><td>Astec 21</td><td>Strategy</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Board game, Cards / tiles</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">PlayStation Store Description (from Ad Blurbs)Shinobi no Roku was first released in 2000, and is a sugoroku game (Japanese backgammon) full of a chimerical jidaigeki (Japanese Edo period drama) taste.

It's up to four stranded heroes - Ripley, Call, DiStephano and Christie - to wipe out the Aliens, and return the ship safely to Earth.Gameplay is standard FPS action, with limited ammo and plenty of hazards to detour around or find the switch to deactivate. The player switches between the four main characters at each level change, each with a slightly different set of abilities (Call has a motion tracker, Christie has his twin pistols from the film). Levels are based around keeping the Auriga running, and making their way through the ship to escape.The game uses a true 3-D engine, allowing for ladders, rooms over rooms, and the ability to look up and down. Aliens also make use of the 3-D space, and can crawl along walls and ceilings, or leap out from the shadows to attack.

You have various basic moves, combos, holds, and so on. The complications come in the form of the huge list of moves, featuring many different styles.

Zidane and his buddies first plan to kidnap Garnet from her mother's palace. But shortly after the kidnapping, they realize the queen of Alexandria is up to something evil. Zidane, the princess, and other characters they encounter on their journey decide to join forces and find out what can possibly drive the queen to commit her cruel deeds.The game's visual style is similar to the previous entry in the Final Fantasy series, with 3D character models, world map, and battle stages, pre-rendered backgrounds in individual locations, and CG cutscenes that advance the story. However, from the point of view of overall atmosphere and gameplay, the game tends to resemble older installments more. Like in Final Fantasy IV, each character belongs to a specific class (e.g. thief, black mage, summoner, etc.) which cannot be changed, having his or her own unique abilities. Combat utilizes the series' trademark ATB (active-time battle) system. Battles allow for the participation of four player-controlled characters. The player is able to choose these from a larger amount of available characters during later parts of the game.Character abilities (magic spells, immunity to certain status changes, etc.) are contained within weapons and armor. Each of these allows the player to learn one or more abilities by equipping the item on a character and continuously participating in battles. Ability points are awarded after battles along with experience points, gradually filling the ability bar of the equipped part. Once the bar is full, the ability can be used by the character even after the equipment that allowed him or her to learn it has been removed.The card mini-game from the previous installment is now called Tetra Master and is featured more prominently. Cards are now placed on a 4x4 grid and can attack other cards on diagonals as well as cardinal directions. Cards no longer have set stats, and instead have a range of values and arrow positions, making every card unique. Regional rule variations are gone, but at the start of every match one to five positions on the grid will be blacked out, changing the player's offensive and defensive strategies with every game.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Star Wars: Demolition</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-11-14</td><td>LucasArts Entertainment Company LLC</td><td>Luxoflux Corp.</td><td>Racing / Driving</td><td>Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Arcade</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">A demoliton derby in the Star Wars universe.

Due to a lack of power, the device can't teleport Donald to Merlock's temple (where Daisy is held) right away. Instead, Donald must successively install reflector dishes at high points at Duckie Mountain, Duckburg and the flying mansion of Magica De Spell before he can reach the temple.The game is a platformer utilizing polygonal graphics, consisting of four worlds, each made up of four regular levels, one optional bonus level and one boss fight. In the regular levels the camera is either placed behind Donald as he runs forward, or at his side, thus emulating classical side-scrolling platform gameplay. In the bonus levels, Donald must flee from something (like a bear, a car, or a rolling boulder), with the camera placed in front of him and him running towards the screen.In the regular levels, the main goal is simply to reach the exit. Doing so gives Donald a power orb: collecting all four of them per world is necessary before the boss fight level opens up. On his way to the exit, Donald must evade pits, traps and enemies. He can jump on top of or kick enemies to dispatch them. Scattered throughout the levels are stars in different colors: yellow stars are worth one, blue stars five, and red stars ten. Collecting 100 of them gains an extra life.There are also several optional challenges: First, Merlock has stolen and enchanted the toys of Donald's nephews. In each regular level, Donald can find three toys. To pick them up, he first has to find one of Merlock's spell books. Picking one up starts a timer counting down the seconds Donald has to pick up the toy. Once all toys in a world are found, the nephews open up the bonus level. The second challenge involves Donald trying to beat his cousin Gladstone's time record. Once a level has been finished, Donald can try the level again, attempting to beat Gladstone's time. Beating the time challenges unlocks bonus costumes that Donald can wear.At the end of each world lies a boss battle against the likes of the Beagle Boys, Magica De Spell and of course Merlock himself. Following the classic formula, each boss attacks in a specific pattern that must be evaded and opens up to counter-attack only for a short time.Some of the game's levels are based closely, others only loosely on those from the Dreamcast/N64 version, with most of Duckburg, two of the boss fights and all of the bonus levels being mostly or entirely new.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">FIFA 2001: Major League Soccer</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-11-15</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Electronic Arts Canada, Software Creations Ltd.</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other), Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control, Multiple units/characters control</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">While series developer EA Canada moved the FIFA soccer series to new graphics engine technology with FIFA 2001 on PC and PlayStation 2, it fell to Software Creations to update the series for the original PlayStation, with graphics similar to those from the previous years' versions and less teams and features than the next generation version.The game includes teams from 16 national leagues (missing the Korean league from the PC/PS2 version) and 58 international teams (10 less than the PC/PS2 version). Gameplay modes are the same as on PS2: exhibition games, season play for the included leagues (without Brazil), tournaments (World Cup, EFA trophy and ECC) and a training mode. There is a player and team editor, but due to engine limitations, players are not modeled after their real-life counterparts as on PS2.Four different camera perspectives are available in-game, customizable in height and zoom factor. Again due to engine limitations, the PS1 version does not feature any licensed stadiums. Controls are mostly the same as on the other versions, with simple, intermediate and advanced controls allowing for headers, volleys, one-touch moves, skill moves and in-game tactics changes. Noticeably absent however is the new power bar mechanic for controlling shot power.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Jimmy White's 2: Cueball</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-11-15</td><td>BAM!

Taloon), the merchant from Dragon Warrior IV. Having become rich and prosperous in the previous game by collecting treasures, Torneko eventually recovered the "Joy Chest" from the very bottom of the dungeon and had it enshrined at his shop. Peace had returned to the town for some time. After awhile, a mysterious stranger arrived and seemed concerned about the Joy Chest being outside the dungeon. At the same time, monsters started reappearing and different parts of the kingdom began turning into "mysterious dungeons". It will be up to middle-aged Torneko, to fight through these strange places and help the king discover what has broken the peace.Like other Fushigi no Dungeon games, Torneko: The Last Hope is a dungeon crawler viewed from the overhead. The dungeons are randomly generated. When venturing into dungeons, Torneko will find many items and fight monsters. He can freely move through the dungeons, but each movement or action of his is countered by those of the monsters (if they are present on screen). All actions are made in turns, so despite the illusion of walking and fighting in real time, the game is turn-based. There are all kinds of items in the dungeons including herbs which can be eaten or thrown, magic scrolls which can be read, swords and shields that can be equipped and staffs which can be waved until their charges are depleted. Players must also keep an eye on Torneko's hunger meter and eat regularly, otherwise Torneko will go into starvation and start losing hitpoints at a great rate.There are several ways to leave a dungeon including death, an Outside Scroll, donating to a Priest or reaching the very bottom floor. When leaving the dungeon areas, Torneko's experience points and stats are lost. To make money, he must sell items he has collected from the dungeon, but may keep a couple of his items in the Storage Room for later use. Torneko's village initially starts small, but as progress in made in the game more and more services and shops will be attracted to it. Some examples of services include a Bread Baker, a Witch, a Blacksmith, a Builder and a Meldersmith.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Animorphs: Shattered Reality</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-11-20</td><td>Infogrames, Inc.</td><td>SingleTrac Entertainment Technologies, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other), Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Animorphs: Shattered Reality is a quasi-3D platformer based on the popular Scholastic book series.  A quick back story: Earth is being secretly conquered by an alien race known as the Yeerks, small slug like creatures that enter a host’s ear, latch onto their brain, and completely control them.  The only thing standing between the Yeerks and total domination is the Animorphs, a group of kids who have the power to morph into any animal form they can touch.  In this game, the leader of the Yeerk invasion, Visser 3, has a plan to finally take over the world.  Using a device called “the Continuum Crystal”, Visser 3 plans to manipulate the space-time continuum in such as to change reality, making his invasion force the rulers of Earth, with no more Animorphs to fight against him.  However, as he activates the continuum crystal, is misfires, shatters itself and the shards of the crystal become scattered.  The Animorphs must collect all the shards of the shattered crystal to prevent Visser 3 from achieving his evil designs.You then control the various members of the Animorphs crew, leading them through several differently themed levels (forests, swamps, urban, factories, underwater, subway tunnels, spacecraft, etc.) to collect the pieces of the crystal.  Most of the gameplay is jumping around on platforms collecting coins, battling aliens (when you encounter an alien, you automatically morph from your human self into your “battle morph”, which is a unique animal for each character), defeating the occasional boss alien, and trying not to fall.  A few levels are more of a 3rd person race, rather than platform based, as you navigate a dolphin, dragonfly, bat, or hawk (one of the Animorphs in another one of their animal forms) down a dangerous path.  All the levels are quite linear in nature.  </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Casper: Friends Around the World</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-11-20</td><td>Sound Source Interactive, Inc.</td><td>Realtime Associates, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Players join Casper in his quest to rescue his lost friends and help them return home after being scattered all over the world by the evil ghost Kibosh.

In addition, each uniquely themed level has a series of amusing booby traps and obstacles that the player can unleash to slow down your foes. The player can make boulders fall, launch giant boxing gloves on springs, and trample the opponents with sheep in the red-rock canyons, get spacecraft to fire lasers in the Martian level, and activate a huge, fat, white horse in the Opera stage to come in and trounce on the enemies.

The visual novel parts of the game contain no interaction with the game and are meant to convey the bulk of the story in the game. These act as the first and last part of each chapter, with the fight section in between. The action sections has the player face off against other labor mechas in various parts of the city. The action leans towards a tactical style of play, where the player needs to let an action bar fill up completely before he/she is able to do any offensive moves against the opponent. In the meantime, the only option is to find a good position from which to rush in and attack, while blocking and avoiding the enemy attacks. The AV-98 Ingram-3 is equipped with a gun, which can be used a limited number of times to fire at the opponent from a distance. The player needs to stand still and aim before firing the gun, and a direct hit causes damage and that the enemy falls over for a short period of time. The biggest part of the fighting is made up of grappling the opponent and trying to rack up high combos of punches, kicks and throws. The longer the chain, the more damage is dealt. Certain attacks will break the chain, so it's important to choose the attacks correctly. Hitting the opponent is done by timing button presses to visual cues on screen.As the game progresses, 3D models of the defeated opponents can be viewed in a special gallery from the main menu of the game, along with information about the respective labor mecha.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Love Hina 2: Kotoba wa Konayuki no You ni</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-11-30</td><td>Konami Computer Entertainment Japan, Inc.</td><td>Konami Computer Entertainment Japan Co., Ltd. </td><td>Adventure</td><td>1st-person</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Visual novel</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Misc</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Released only two months after the first game, Love Hina: Ai wa Kotoba no Naka ni, this game mimics everything from the first one, from gameplay to design.

The main objective is to guide a cartoon character moving through an ascending pile of multicolored tiles, pushing the available blocks to create clusters of the same color. Groups of four or more tiles of matching colors can be removed by punching one of the connected blocks, with the vacant space being occupied by the falling stacks on top. The descending tiles that end up rearranged in new color clusters are automatically eliminated and give combo points.As the tiles accumulate on the screen, the water level at the bottom starts to proportionally rise, receding when enough blocks are destroyed. The health meter for the main character is displayed below the gamefield, decreasing when suffering injuries from bomb explosions or drowning. The character also dies after being crushed against the top by the blocks. Power-ups and other items can be found inside containers that randomly appear on the pile, that have to be broke open with three punches to reveal their contents. The blue items give bonus points, eliminate all the tiles of a particular color, lower the water level and help in other ways, while the red items do the opposite and have to be avoided.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Favorite Dear: Jyunpaku no Yogensha</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2000-12-07</td><td>NEC Interchannel, Ltd.</td><td>NEC Interchannel, Ltd.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td>Isometric</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">PlayStation Store Description (from Ad Blurbs)Purchase this PS one® Classic and play it on both your PS3™ and PSP® (PlayStation®Portable) systems!

The main game involves a 15 year career managing an English Football team (Premier, 1st, 2nd or 3rd division). There are also 14 shorter challenges ranging from winning the treble with 3 games left to winning 3 successive promotions from division 3 to the Premier in 3 seasons. The player is responsible for selecting the team line-up and tactics, buying and selling players on the European transfer market, selecting training schedules and managing the club's finances.Unlike other console football management games of the time which were ports of existing PC titles, the LMA Manager titles were designed exclusively for the PlayStation. The game is notable for its intuitive control system, where the L1 and R1 shoulder buttons of the controller switch between different sections of the game (e.g. from the Transfers section to the Squad section), and L2 and R2 switch between sub-screens within a section (e.g. from the Select Team screen to Editing Tactics). The graphics of the first game, which had a rather retro look, have been improved to a more modern clean-looking design. The game provides a mini 3D match where the manager can make tactical changes during gameplay and 3D highlights afterwards commented by Alan Hansen (former Liverpool player turned BBC commenter).International versions were sold under different localized titles: 
BDFL Manager in Germany (Bund Deutscher Fußball-Lehrer, basically the German equivalent of the LMA), Manager de Liga in Spain, Football Manager Campionato in Italy, and Roger Lemerre - La Sélection des Champions in France.Only teams from the home country could be managed although all 294 teams were included in each game for use in the transfer market and European cup competitions.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Legend of Pocahontas</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2001</td><td>Midas Interactive Entertainment Ltd.</td><td>Code Monkeys Ltd., The</td><td>Puzzle</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>North America</td><td></td><td>Point and select</td><td></td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Back of Jewel Case - Playstation (EU) (from Ad Blurbs)When European settlers settle on her father's land, Pocahontas persuades the chief not to go to war, and talks begin with their strange new neighbours.

The player takes the role of Nick Logan who has the unique ability to see through alien disguises and accompanies him during his work: catching aliens to save the world. The gameplay principle is simple: the player walks through 15 levels with a fixed camera perspective and shoots everything he sees, e.g. werewolves or vampires. To do this he uses one of the many weapons he finds - all of them have unlimited ammo but have to regenerate energy during pauses of fire. But the player doesn't kill his enemies for good: He has to catch them with his alien trap (which is a matter of pressing one button) or they regenerate.Besides the shooting the game also features its share of puzzles, e.g. activating a mechanism, and bosses. There is also a mini game which comes into place whenever Logan has to disable a bomb or open a lock: basically a series of quick time events where the player has to press the correct button with the right timing. The levels are divided into five areas: London, Ireland, San Francisco, a Maya temple and Roswell.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Sabrina, the Teenage Witch: A Twitch in Time!</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2001</td><td>Knowledge Adventure, Inc.</td><td>Asylum Entertainment Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In this 3D action-adventure, Sabrina's cat, Salem, accidentally breaks the Cosmic Clock.

Now, it's up to Sabrina to find and recover the pieces of the clock, and stop Chaos.Gameplay should be familiar; run and jump through each of the 4 time periods (there are multiple levels in each time period, and not all areas are visitable the first time through), cast spells at the many enemies you encounter, and collect items. Redeem gems to buy new outfits, which allow you to visit new areas, and replace misplaced items to open new paths.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Saiyuki: Journey West</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2001</td><td>KOEI Corporation</td><td>Fu-Qi</td><td>Role-playing (RPG), Strategy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td>Everyone</td><td>Isometric</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Saiyuki: Journey West is loosely based on one of the four classical novels of Chinese literature, Journey to the West (Chinese: Xi You Ji) by the 16th century writer Wu Cheng'en. This tactical RPG lets the players take the role of the novel's hero who is also a historical character, the 7th century scholar and Buddhist monk Xuanzang (Japanese pronunciation: Sanzo) and his monster companions, including the famous monkey Sun Wukong (Japanese pronunciation: Son Goku), as they travel to India. The game takes quite a few liberties with the original tale, including allowing the player to change Xuanzang's gender, giving each monster a more powerful "were-" form, and tying each character, save Xuanzang's, to an elemental affinity.The real meat of the game is the tactical battles, where careful unit placement and use of each monster's unique special abilities determine the outcome of the battle.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Scrabble</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2001</td><td>Ubi Soft Entertainment Software</td><td>Runecraft Ltd.</td><td>Strategy</td><td>1st-person, Top-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Board game, Word construction</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Scrabble is a computerised version of the popular word game for Windows for one to four players.

Elmo rollerblades with in-line skates, Ernie navigates rapids in his bathtub with a kayak paddle, Telly sleds down icy slopes in a saucer, Cookie Monster bounces on a hopper ball, Zoe rides dirt tracks in a big wheel, and Grover pedals on a unicycle.On each course, players can collect up to 18 tokens.

You can practice your moves or compete against another player or computer.When beginning a game, your chosen team of four skydivers will jump and then you have a limited time to complete more four-person formations than your opponent.  Doing a correct formation will slow your descent, giving you more time to execute more tricks.  To perform a formation correctly you must correctly enter the button sequence displayed on the screen within a short period of time. If you do this correctly your four skydivers will move into the formation. Formations are performed in sequence; if you miss one you must return to the beginning of the sequence and start over. You try to do as many tricks as possible before your team falls too low and they must pull their parachutes.You can also "attack" your opponent - by performing tricks successfully you fill up your attack meter.  When it is full you can execute an attack and force the other team to defend itself by performing a defensive formation. If the other team fails in its defense, it will fall at a higher rate of speed.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Smurf Racer</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2001</td><td>Infogrames, Inc.</td><td>Artificial Mind & Movement</td><td>Racing / Driving</td><td>Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Arcade</td><td></td><td>Automobile, Track racing, Vehicle simulator</td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This kart racer features the Smurfs as characters.

Not surprisingly the game itself is unchanged with the exception of new questions. The player takes the role of a candidate and has to answer 15 questions by choosing the correct answer out of four given possibilities. For every right answer he receives money but he also loses money when choosing poorly (there are two "guarantee points"  where he falls back to so he doesn't lose all). There are also three jokers: eliminating two false answers, asking the viewers in the studio per poll and phoning a friend. In the game the latter is a prerecorded conversation.The multiplayer mode is restricted to "Fastest Finger" competition where the next candidate is chosen. Here the players have to bring the four given answers into the right order and the fastest one wins. More questions are downloadable through the internet.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: Junior</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2001</td><td>Eidos Interactive Limited</td><td>Hothouse Creations Ltd.</td><td>Puzzle</td><td>Text-based / Spreadsheet</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Board game, Game show / trivia / quiz</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: Junior is a quiz game based on the successful TV show for one to four players.

Yakinikubugyō puts you in the role of a BBQ chef, and it's your job to make sure the customers leave happy and full from your restaurant.The goal of each stage in the game is to make sure you keep all 3 customers happy when the timer runs out by handing out the right food to the right person, while making sure it's not undercooked or burned to a black piece of coal. The customers each have a food they like and one they hate, and they can suddenly change their minds in the middle of a stage, so figuring out what they want to eat and when is the key to success. You can also earn combos by feeding the same customer several times in a row with food they like.You use chop sticks to maneuver around a 3x4 squares big grill where you have to put down pieces of meat and vegetables and grill them to perfection. The closer to the middle of the grill you put the food, the faster it cooks, so if you have a customer yelling at you to hand him/her something, you can put the food there.If you're too slow or forget about a piece of food, it slowly turns to coal and you have to tap it to clean the grate. Otherwise you won't be able to use that square again.You can either play alone or against a friend. The game is sponsored by Gyu-Kaku, a chain of Japanese BBQ restaurants.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Zoboomafoo: Leapin' Lemurs!</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2001</td><td>Encore Software, Inc.</td><td>Big Grub</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td>Brandon Humphreys</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Zoboomafoo: Leapin' Lemurs! is a game based on the Kratt Brothers TV series Zoboomafoo.

One day, the school is struck by an enormous earthquake. Upon waking up, Shō finds himself lost in the ruins. He manages to find Yuka and Hikaru, along with their professor Akiho, and hurriedly try to run away from the crumbling ruins. Upon exiting, it turns out that, beyond the school walls, there is no Tokyo or any other city. Rather, they realize that they have been teleported to a new world of Eithéa. Thus begins their adventure to find a way back to Earth, while being entangled in a brewing conflict in the new world.Eithéa (pronounced as "aye-thee-ah") is a Japanese RPG that follows a strictly linear, but very long storyline, focused on the protagonist and his company from both Earth and the world of Eithéa. The player controls the characters in the overworld from the bird-eye view, while combat is isometric. The game consists of progressing the story through completing the main storyline, upgrading characters' equipment, triggering certain points in the game and talking to important characters.The combat is done in a traditional turn-based way, like many JRPG contemporaries, and is triggered through random encounters. However, the system has two important gimmicks. The first is that players are given the option of applying multiple stances and formations of the party that best suit a situation. Enemies can come and attack from four directions, meaning that players have to carefully strategize to win. Attacks from behind deal greater damage, so players need to be careful where to place characters during combat. The other gimmick introduced is the "Barrier". Characters that stay inside a barrier (summoned by characters that possess "forms") take half the damage, while exiting the barrier results in much higher damage. Characters can be melee-based or projectile-based and each of these two classes have their own advantages and disadvantages.The game also features a character progression system. Players can make choices that deepen their relationship with others in the party, which can result in romance with them as the story goes.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Pocket Digimon World: Cool &amp; Nature Battle Disc</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2001-02-22</td><td>Bandai Co., Ltd.</td><td></td><td>Simulation</td><td>Side view, Text-based / Spreadsheet</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Managerial / business simulation, RPG elements</td><td></td><td></td><td>Menu structures</td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">A Museum was opened in the Digimon World.

When a gunshot is fired in his office, he realizes that he has no other choice but to help the poor girl. Through conversations with her over the phone, Cyan tries to shed light on the memories that haunt her...Forget Me Not: Palette is a remake of a freeware adventure game originally created in RPG Maker 95 featuring all new graphics, cutscenes with voice acting, music and a UI more suitable for the game. Players will need to have the psychiatrist call B.D. to gain control of her and go through nodes connecting different areas of her house, identifying various objects to help her find out what happened. Going through each node will have B.D. lose her energy and once she has no energy remaining, she will complain that her head hurts, hang up the phone and players will have to call her again to start over.Collecting shreds of memories will allow B.D. to gain extra energy and players will need to find a place to "put" these shreds in order to unlock new nodes. There are some areas where B.D. can partly recover her energy and players will need to take note of those areas in order to progress through the game as they may not be able to acquire enough energy to progress otherwise.

The player controls a car and races around tracks as fast as possible. By collecting pick-ups new properties can be obtained, such as nitro boosts, oil slicks, projectiles and other weapons. The computer-controlled cars can also collect the pick-ups and use them.Cars have the ability to transform into four different types of vehicles: racing, truck, plane and boat. While transforming the body of the car stays the same while the side of the car "grows" wheels, wings or fins. The stages are divided into different parts, each designed for a specific vehicle.

The Minis promptly steal the secret M&Ms formulas and cause havoc at the factory. It is up to the yellow candy to set the situation right.The gameplay has been described as being similar to the Crash Bandicoot series. The action in the game takes place over 8 levels. The first 7 levels involve some kind of math skill (configurable at various skill levels to cover addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The first level depicts the yellow candy frantically driving back to the candy factory. Along the way are math formulas on the side of the road, followed closely by 3 crates on the road, each with a number. Striking the crate with the correct answer for the previous formula will allow passage, while the 2 wrong answers are steel crates that will end your vehicle. The same action is repeated in a later level involving a forklift.Another type of level has the yellow candy jumping from number platform to number platform according to the math formulas that a disembodied female voice calls out. Another type of level is a 3D running/jumping action level in which the yellow candy will run down a hallway while observing clues about math formulas along the way. At the end of the hallway will be 3 doors, each with a possible answer. Choose wisely.All along the way are M&Ms candies to be collected in large quantities. Every 100 M&Ms candies earns the player an extra life.The PlayStation version is basically the same game but minus the Math mode.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Rocket Power: Team Rocket Rescue</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2001-09-04</td><td>THQ Inc.</td><td>Darkblack Ltd</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Rocket Power: Team Rocket Rescue is a game designed to represent the Nickelodeon Rocket Power license.

A meter at the top of the screen shows the current position and the amount of nitro fuel available. Extra fuel can be collected as shiny orbs on the road. The gift boxes contain random power-ups, like coconuts to throw at the other racers, flash lights to temporally blind them, and traps like baby powder, trash cans and green goo to slow down the competition.The game has four modes for single player. The main cups mode is the championship, where the objective is to arrive at least in third place to qualify for the next race. In time trial mode, the goal is to complete laps as fast as possible, with a ghost car showing the fastest performance to be surpassed. Race for fun is a practice mode, where any of the tracks can be explored without the pressure to win. In relay mode, the player switches characters after each lap.There are three modes for multiplayer. The cups and relay modes are similar to their solo counterparts, but splitting the screen horizontally in the middle to show the two players.

Other characters are controlled by the AI, but the player can also choose to switch between characters at any time, micro-manage their actions, or assign general strategies.

Your job is to help Polpo, the landlord, manage the mansion by keeping everyone as happy as possible, collecting rent, upgrading the mansion and fending off criminals.In One Piece Mansion, you will start off with a certain number of floors and a certain number of residents.  At the end of the month, you will have to collect rent. You can build new rooms for tenants that wish to move in and by installing elevators, you can build new floors and make the mansion expand. Just make sure you have enough money to make the upgrades/changes.The residents can affect each other in either a positive or negative way, depending on their own living habits. Some tenants will exert positive effects in the form of blue arrows into certain directions (up, down, left, right and/or diagonally). By placing another tenant where these arrows are aiming at will help diminish their stress. At the same time, some tenants will exert negative effects in the form of red arrows.  Tenants on the receiving end of these arrows will get stressed out. You can switch tenants around and make new rooms for them but it will cost you money. The key is to arrange the tenants in a certain way so that they all balance each other out harmoniously...otherwise they will leave without paying rent and the room will explode - forcing you to lose income and dish out to repair the damage. To prevent this from happening, you will have to observe your tenants Stress Gauge that tells you their current stress level. Another factor to watch out for is Syndicate 5 - a group of criminals that moves in and disturbs your tenants.  When they do, try to drive them out by placing tenants around them that will send them red arrows. Every now and then they may go out of their room and cause trouble. If that happens, change to Security mode and move Polpo to where the criminal is. When he's there, Polpo can blow his alarm whistle at the criminals which will send them scurrying back to their hide-out.The game has two modes: Story and Endless.In Story Mode, Putica, Polpo's little sister, is kidnapped by Chocopape who is jealous of One Piece Mansion's success. To save Putica, Polpa must complete 7 orders. These orders are goals that must be met before you can tackle the next stage. The goals include making a certain amount of income, building a certain number of rooms or building a certain number of floors. Can Polpo handle all these challenges? Well it is up to you to make sure he does! The game is divided into stages and every now and then you will have to confront a "Boss". Just drive them out as you do the criminals.In Endless Mode you can select from 3 difficulty settings: Easy, Normal and Hard. There are no stages or ending, you just try to run One Piece Mansion your own way and see how far you can go.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Castlevania Chronicles</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2001-10-01</td><td>Konami of America, Inc.</td><td>Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td>Horror</td><td>Arcade, Platform</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The plot of Castlevania Chronicles is similar to that of the first Castlevania: in the end of the 17th century the dreadful vampire Dracula is resurrected after a century of slumber.

Barbazoo (yellow): Loves nature and animals. His game is a side scrolling game where he collects apples, avoids spiky balls falling from trees as well as bees and badgers.
Barbalala (green): Loves music. Her game lets the player pick up to three different instruments, which will correspond to one of three buttons on the controller (+ vocals on a fourth). Then the player can play music live using the set instruments.
Barbalib (orange): Loves books. In her game she shape shifts into an item, and using her shape as a clue, the player will have to assemble a 4 piece puzzle (each piece has 3 alternatives).
Barbabeau (black and furry): Loves art. In his game the player gets to pick between Barbapapa and Barbamama to use as a model for a picture. Then the player gets to pick any of three shapes to turn them into, as well as a background picture. Barbabeau will then paint a picture using the selected choices made by the player.
Barbabelle (purple): Loves beauty. Her game has the player identify items by choosing the corresponding word out of three alternatives.
Barbabright (blue): Loves science. In his game he turns into an airplane in a ravine, and the player has to help control him to gather balloons while avoiding vultures. The game scrolls "into" the screen and the plane is seen from behind.
Barbabravo (red): Loves bravery and heroism. His game is a snowball fight where four of his siblings have turned into fortresses with button symbols underneath. When Barbabravo peeks up from behind one, the player presses the corresponding button to throw a snowball at him to get points. If the family dog peeks out, however, the player has to avoid throwing or he/she will get a point deducted from the score.
The game was developed for use with the Kids Station peripheral. If played with a standard controller, it makes exclusive use of the face buttons (square, triangle, X and circle).

The planet Earth sets up a research station, Vita Base, on Mars with the mission to discover if life did exist there. After a discovery there comes one last garbled message—danger, danger cliché approaching--“have opened Pandora’s box… all the evils of old Mars have flown out,” and a warning, “…if you do send a manned mission, warn the crew…Stay Alone, Stay Alive…” then nothing. So now it’s 2018, and your rescue mission to Mars crash lands. When you get to the base, the welcome wagon is made up of zombies and an alien virus that will make you look back fondly on the days of the Black Plague. You control a team of three: Kenzo, Karne and Matlock. They enter the base from different airlocks and try to discover what happened. The reason for the whole "Stay alone, stay alive" warning is that if your team members come together they end up forming into a disgusting mass of flesh -- picture the thing from Leviathan -- called a Trimorph. As you proceed though the base you find clues as to what occurred. In addition, you run into Trimorphs, some of the non zombiefied former base crew, that are bent on your destruction. They come in two sizes -- the small spidery kind which hack at your shins and jump on your face or the huge "better run like hell" monstrosities that will tear you to pieces. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2001-11-16</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Argonaut Games PLC</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Puzzle elements</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">One of several different games based on the first Harry Potter book and movie, the version for the PlayStation is a three-dimensional action adventure.To complete his first year of studies at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and foil the evil Lord Voldemort's plans, Harry must complete a number of challenges.

The remade version has received a complete graphical overhaul. It features fully 3D graphics and 2D sprites for characters; the visual style resembles that of Dragon Warrior VII. Battles now have backgrounds that represent the location the battle takes place in. Interaction with some of the environment is now physical, as the characters can visible raise, hold, and break barrels, pots, etc. The music has also been enhanced significantly, with orchestra-like quality. The main gameplay change is the possibility to directly control characters who were AI-controlled in the original version. The AI system is still present, but the player can turn it off and command all the characters manually. A "party talk" feature is now available: it is possible to talk to the characters in the party at any time. The remake also features additional sub-quests and mini-games, such as building an immigrant town and monster collecting. A prologue as well as a post-game chapter were added to the game; the latter offers more insight into the game's story.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Mr. Driller G</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2001-11-22</td><td>Namco Limited</td><td>Namco Limited</td><td>Action, Puzzle</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Falling block puzzle, Platform</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Mr. Driller G is a another entry in Namco's series of arcade puzzle games. As in the previous titles, the main objective is to control a miner character and dig through layers of multi-colored blocks to reach the deeper levels of a shaft and score points. As sections are removed, the whole structure becomes unstable and dangerous. When large pieces of the same color fall on top of each other, they automatically disappear. The miner can be squished by the crumbling stones, or suffocate by lack of oxygen. Air pills and power-ups are found scattered throughout the level, and must be collected to refill the supply, shown as a meter at the right side of the screen. Special brown blocks act as a barrier and have to be drilled several times to break, removing a portion of the remaining air after being destroyed.The single player game has three modes. In mission mode, the objective is to reach a specific depth and make as many points as possible, with several levels available to play right from the beginning. In scenario mode, cutscenes play between a linear succession of levels, where each shaft has to be completed to move the plot forwards. In time attack mode, the air pills are replaced with clocks that add a few seconds to the time remaining to reach the bottom of the mine.The normal arcade mode has multiplayer variations that can be played locally with two controllers, where the screen is split vertically in the middle showing two separate mine shafts for each player. In Driller Race, the objective is to reach the deep end of a randomly generated shaft as fast as possible, while in Driller Survival the players try to outlast each other in bottomless mines.There is an option called Net Driller, that generates passwords to be used on the official site for competitions and global rankings. Support for it was discontinued on January 30th, 2003.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">pop'n music 5</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2001-11-22</td><td>Konami Corporation</td><td>Konami Computer Entertainment Studios, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Music / rhythm</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">pop'n music 5 is one of the many titles in Konami's long-running rhythm game franchise.

If you think a quiz game may not be the best use of their skills then think again. This isn't just a collection of thousands of football trivia questions with points scored for each correct answer - that would be too simple. The football fans at Sports Interactive have managed to create a quiz game that not only mixes football knowledge but also the rules and tactics involved in the sport too. The quiz is played out like a real game of football. You see the pitch and two sets of teams and get to pick who you want to play as at the start. The idea is to pick your favourite team as the questions will really probe your love for the club. From the kick-off, you must pass the ball around the field by answering questions correctly. Below the shirt of each player are question categories. Pass the ball to that player and answer the question correctly to keep possession. Of course, answer a question incorrectly and the ball goes to the opposition. Get the ball to a striker, answer the question correctly and you've scored. Whoever gets the most questions correct is irrelevant; the game is decided on who scores the most goals. There are over 11,000 questions so you shouldn't see many being repeated often - in comparison, last year's Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? game only contained 1,000! The questions cover a broad range of football knowledge too, from domestic to international, third division to golden boot winners. There are five different modes of play, including penalty shoot out, pub quiz where more than two can play and keepy-uppy where you've got to answer correctly for as long as possible. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Popstar Maker</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2001-11-30</td><td>Eidos Interactive Limited</td><td>Teque Software Development Ltd.</td><td>Simulation</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td>Managerial / business simulation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Look at the charts today, inundated with manufactured bands.

Players can choose to play as either Baby Felix, Kitty, or Tattoo, plus four others can be unlocked by achieving set challenges in-game.  It is a standard tennis game with an angled view so that the opponent's court is smaller than the opposing player's and as the character approaches the net, the camera view slightly follows it. There is a training mode and a progressive Championship mode.  On different court surfaces, the ball moves differently. There is a meter for the serve where hitting it at a different point will give it a spin.

It includes both national and club teams (from England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain), plus the ability to create custom teams,  with details ranging from the usual name, strips and colours to the stadium. Other than Beckham himself, no player is licensed (likeness is preserved, but names are replaced with phonetic equivalents, such as “Owin” or “Zanetee”), but the editor also allows the player to customize each player and team.
Game modes include friendly, club season, several international cups (including the defunct Home Championship), Classic Matches (some featuring the highlights of Beckham's career, others just classic matches), Beat Brazil, where the player starts with France, and tries to beat Brazil with a progressively weaker team, Survival, where the player face top international teams, with goals against carrying over, until the player loses a match, and Train With Beckham, a series of  drill minigames destined to teach the basics of the game and unlock “secrets”. Gameplay is similar to previous titles developed by the company (most notably Microsoft Football 2000 and UEFA Striker), and not unlike Beckham, has its strong point during dead ball situations, where the player can choose either to use a set play to get the defense offguard, or take a direct shot or swerving pass using the traditional arrow indicator.
In terms of options, the game doesn’t offer much to tweak, only bookings, offsides, injuries, match length and the decider (simple or golden goal overtime and penalty shootout)</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Dinomaster Party</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002</td><td>Light & Shadow Production</td><td>Similis Software GmbH</td><td>Action</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Mini-games, Party game</td><td>Prehistoric</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Back of Jewel Case - PlayStation (UK) (from Ad Blurbs)DINOMASTER PARTY

The games that can be played in this product are:
Seven In A Row: For four players. All cards are dealt and players take turns playing a card, the first player to play all their cards wins. Cards are played sequentially by suit and each suit starts with the seven and builds both up to the king and down to the ace. The game is played in levels, to progress to the next level the player must finish either first of second on a five round match. To complete level four the player must finish first.
The Rich Man: Players take it in turn to play a card, the card they play must be higher than the card played by the previous player. The first player to play all their cards wins. At the end of the first round the winning player is termed 'The Millionaire', the second player is 'Rich', the third player is 'Poor' and the fourth player is 'Destitute'. 'Destitute' must give their two best cards to 'The Millionaire', 'Poor' must give their best card to 'Rich'. Millionaire and 'Rich' must give cards to Destitute' and 'Poor' but they can give any cards they wish. Under certain conditions card strength is reversed which affects the game dramatically. Players start with twenty points and gain or lose points depending on how well they do, and they complete a level by finishing first in a ten round match.
Splash: Players play card(s) to match the value of the card on the table, the first player to play all their cards wins. They win instantly (i.e. The 'Splash') if the total value of their hand matches the table card. The game is a variation on 'Crazy Eights' as it has similar special cards. Eight's change the suit of the next player's discard, Jack's cause the next player to miss a turn, Ten's reverse the order of play and Two's make the next player pick up two additional cards from the deck. To clear a level the player must finish in the top two of a ten round match.
Page One: is another Crazy Eight variant. Players play card(s) to match the value of the card on the table, the first player to play all their cards wins. The special cards in this game are Eight's which change the suit of the next player's discard, Jack's which cause the next player to miss a turn, Queen's which reverse the order of play and Two's which make the next player pick up two additional cards from the deck. A further twist is that when a player holds just one card they must press triangle, if they don't they are required to pick an additional five cards from the deck. To clear a level the player must finish in the top two of a ten round match.
Seven Bridges: Players are dealt cards and take turns exchanging one card from their hand with a card from the deck. When they have three cards of the same value or three cards of the same suit they can place them on the 'table'. Cards can also be added to sets and sequences laid by other players. The first person to dispose of all their cards wins. Players start with points and lose points for every card remaining their hand when a round is over. To clear a level the player must finish in the top two after a ten round match. To complete level four they must finish top. 
Old Maid/Old Man: These are two variations on the same game. Old Maid is played with a fifty two card deck and one joker. Cards are discarded in pairs and the first person to dispose of all their cards wins. Old Man is played the same way but one card is removed from the fifty two card deck. In both games playing a Jack's causes the next player to miss a turn while Queen's reverse the order of play.
Speed: This game supports one or two players. It is not turn based, players play cards that are sequential to the table card as fast as they can. The first player to dispose of all their cards wins.
Poker: This is Five Card Draw poker. Players start with credit and aim to win as much as possible, it plays like a video poker game of 'Jacks High'. This product does not use a memory card to store a player's progress but in Poker the player can press the SELECT button and the game will generate a password which they can use in future games to restore their credit. Pressing the START button swaps the player into the Blackjack game.
Blackjack: This is a standard Blackjack game in which the player can generate passwords or swap into the Poker game as described above. The player's winnings are multiplied if they have special card combinations, for example 'Blackjack' - having the cards add up to twenty-one -  multiplies the stake by five while a six card sequence adding up to twenty-one multiplies the stake by fifty. In both Poker and Blackjack when the player wins a hand they can choose to play a 'double or nothing' game such as 'Red or Black', Hi-Card select', Hi-Lo' etc
Concentration: This is a game for one to four players. Forty cards are dealt face down and players take turns revealing a pair of cards looking for a matching pair.
Each game has customisable rules, and adjustable AI strength.

Play as Gismo, Karrie, Zero, BOW or Kami - each with a background story, unique special weapon, and alternate vehicle designs that can be unlocked. You race in five distinct worlds: a group of linked islands (Archipelago), a droid factory (Droid Gardens), a desert wasteland (Terrian Dunes), an industrial area (Sky Port) and a wealthy city (Aerial City). While racing, the personal weapon is stored in the left weapon bay. Random weapons that can be picked up by all racers are stored on the right. There are both offensive and defensive specials, including missiles, rockets, cannons, turbo, shield and a worm hole that teleports your opponents. Upon completing a perfect lap, you receive a special weapon, such as the stasis beam (immobilization) or the time warp (slow opponents down).Vehicles can be slowed down but not destroyed, so he who crosses the finish line first still takes it all. The game uses 360° aerodynamics, which allow you to drive on walls and ceilings. Those game mechanics were previously used in ATD's Rollcage series. The single player mode includes championships divided over three leagues with increasing difficulty. Each league contains five worlds, with a different theme, and each character has a homeworld. There are qualifier races, heats (one-on-one) and final races where the grid is based on the results of the previous races. You can also test drive all 25 tracks in the practice mode, or go head-to-head with split-screen multiplayer. The game's soundtrack is provided by the Bomfunk MCs.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Formula GP</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002</td><td>Midas Interactive Entertainment Ltd.</td><td>Kung Fu Ltd.</td><td>Racing / Driving</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Automobile, Track racing</td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Back of Jewel Case - PlayStation (UK) (from Ad Blurbs)Formula G.P. lets you take control of the most powerful racing cars on the planet.

The rules are simple: whoever wins five opponents is the winner. The location of the tournament can be anywhere, even outside school. Following this, the party from the show decides to participate in the tournament, in hope of winning prize money.The game is a Donjara, which is different from the standard Chinese or Japanese rules of mahjong. Donjara is basically a simplified version of Japanese "Riichi" mahjong. Firstly, the game is played by only two players, as opposed to four in standard play. Instead of a winning hand of three sets and a pair, Donjara only allows for three sets of same tiles. Unlike Riichi mahjong, where players do not have to call Riichi if they lack only one tile to finish the hand, in Donjara players must declare Riichi before they can actually win.Instead of traditional set of bamboo, coins and characters, Donjara uses a limited set of tiles. Numbers on tiles do not have to be equal or ascending; the tile marking and color is enough to create a set. In this game's case, all tiles are based on characters from the manga/anime. All of the main characters of the show appear in this game and they are voiced by their respective voice actors/actresses. The player can go through the game as a story, or create a match of their choice. When playing in story mode, the player selects their main character, as well as an assist character. Players can change to their selected assists before or after each round. Each match consists of five rounds. Whoever has the highest points is the winner.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Dance Dance Revolution: Konamix</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-04-24</td><td>Konami of America, Inc.</td><td>Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Music / rhythm</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The hottest dancing craze continues with a brand new sequel to Dance Dance Revolution.

The game features three separate episodes (third one becomes available after clearing the first two which can be played in any order) where you play as Shinichi Kudou (aka Conan Edogawa) trying to uncover the mystery and use your deductive skills and reasoning to point to the perpetrator. The game features full voice acting and characters are moderately animated during dialogues, and all that is aided with actual anime cutscenes which feels like watching an actual episode from the series, only this time doing a bit more than just watching. Each of the episode also lets you select whether the subtitles should use kanji or only hiragana.The basic gameplay boils down to:

 Dialogues -- During key dialogues with other characters, text will turn blue when you have a chance to gain a clue. By pressing the right button, you can perform so-called "detective action" which will give you more information about your point of interest and provide you with a clue in your investigation. This will effectively raise your AP percentage bar which displays points of achievement for the current scenario. In turn, it will add reasoning chips to Reasoning Mode in the menu.
 Movement -- Conan moves in 3rd-person perspective. You can go to check various locations in search for clues with mini-map showing your current location.
 Examining -- By clicking next to the objects of interest, they will appear on the screen where you can use magnifying glass to look at suspicious elements in more detail.
 Mini-games -- By successfully clearing mini-games you can obtain clues that will aid you in your investigation.
 Reasoning -- With collected Reasoning Chips awarded by obtaining various clues during your investigation, you can try and put it all together and present a final solution to the case.

The story episodes are:

 Rou Tejinashi to Tramp no Nazo (老手品師とトランプの謎) -- Accompanied by Conan's old friend who knows his true identity, the inventor Hiroshi Agasa, Conan and his classmates, Ayumi, Mitsuhiko and Genta, as well as Ai Haibara, the woman in same situation as Conan, arrive at the amusement park in order to see twin baby-pandas, just open to the public. While watching for their turn, they encounter an incident at the magician's performance where after a mysterious phone call, the cards fall out of magician's and into Conan's hands. Whatever rattled his cage and whoever was the person on the other side of the line is not going to go unnoticed and unquestioned by Conan and his league of junior school detectives. Kamen Kishi Satsujinjiken (仮面騎士殺人事件) -- Ran, Sonoko, and Conan arrive at the opening of a new theater. The musical program was playing a love story. However, second act never opened. Instead, a scream from backstage flew through the air. The stage actor was murdered, with a knife, no less. Conan is yet again to put his mind to the task and unmask the killer. Saikou no Partner (最高の相棒) -- Participants of a TV show called "Reasoning Colosseum: Snow Country Steam Murder Case", along with the staff, were sharing express train to Aomori with none other than renowned private investigator Mouri Kogorou and his daughter (Shinichi's girlfriend) Ran. But on the location of the show, the actual murder was done on board the train. Now it's up to Mouri to use his reasoning and find out who the culprit is. This episode becomes available only after clearing the other two.

Like in other life simulation games with artificial intelligence, the creatures can't be commanded directly and must learn behavior patterns through repeated actions.

A series of meters at the bottom of the screen show the population status.The game takes place in space, inside a giant station with a domed ceiling protecting a closed ecosystem.

There are blue stars scattered throughout the scenery, and the creatures can be trained to fetch and store them inside a machine, generating a new key after twenty-five stars.

As Climber scales a building, he is able to climb up and sideways but he cannot climb down.
While climbing a building, windows will open and close simultaneously. If any window closes on either of his hands he will lose his grip. However, if a window closes on both of his hands, he will fall to his death, resulting in the loss of a life. You have three Climbers in total, but you are awarded an extra Climber every 30,000 points. Besides windows, Climber is faced with other dangers, including:Bald-headed guys who hurl various objects at you.
Pesky condors who fly by, dropping eggs and droppings of an unpleasant substance.
Falling steel girders and iron dumbells.
Electrical "Nichibutsu" signs with a dangling live wire.
Falling "Crazy Climber" signs.
King Kong leaping from side to side of the building and slams his hands against the windows.The climber must try to avoid or overcome each of those hazards which he will encounter as he continues climbing in his attempt to reach the rooftop. If he falls to his death by windows or objects,  another climber will replace him and will start at the same location where the last one fell. The specific danger will not be present at the same point, so the climber can go further up to face the next danger. Most of the hazards are announced by certain recognizable musical themes. Crazy Climber is awarded a bonus score on each building every time after getting carried off by the helicopter. However, each bonus score will decrease by every ten seconds that the climber will spend scaling each building as he attempts reach the top. Somewhere in the game, there is "The Lucky Balloon", which can lift Climber about ten stories and raise the player's bonus score if he catches it.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Gekisha Boy</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-05-23</td><td>D3Publisher Inc.</td><td>Irem Software Engineering, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td>Comedy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Gekisha Boy is a 2D side-scrolling game in which you play the part as a camera man who is out to snap some high paying photos to please their contractor.

She also has a throw when near enemies.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">RC Helicopter</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-06-12</td><td>Agetec, Inc.</td><td>Tomcat System</td><td>Action, Simulation</td><td>3rd-person (Other), Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Helicopter, Vehicle simulator</td><td></td><td>Real-time</td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Your Dad just got you an RC Helicopter. Play with it, or take it outside to complete various missions for friends and family. The missions range from cutting the grass in your backyard, to filming ghosts. With each mission, you earn points to upgrade your helicopter, (or even get new helicopters) and unlock more missions. Just be careful; your helicopter is somewhat fragile, and has a limited battery life.RC Helicopter is a flight simulator of radio-controlled toy helicopters originally released as part of the Simple 1500 budget line in Japan. The helicopter is maneuvered with the analog sticks of the DualShock controller. The left stick controls the movement while the right stick makes the aircraft go up and down. A battery meter and a hit counter at the top right corner show the remaining energy left and the number of bumps that the helicopter can sustain. When the battery is drained or the machine received too many hits, the game is over and the mission has to be restarted.The main objective is to complete all the missions available from the city map screen. At the beginning of each one, a character asks the player to perform a specific task with the helicopter. In some cases, the toy is equipped with special tools to complete the mission, like a squirt gun and a claw that can be activated by pressing the R1 shoulder button. In the first missions, the aircraft has to be used to transport soda cans to a garbage pail, cut grass with its blades, splash birds with the water gun, blow baseballs from a roof, recover document folders from train tracks and other challenges.After completing a mission the characters give money as a reward, that can used to repair any damage to the helicopter and recharge its batteries. The mission money can also be spent on items from the RC shop. The player can purchase new helicopter models and upgrades, like a more resilient body for the machine, and more durable batteries.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">London Racer II</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-06-14</td><td>Davilex Games B.V.</td><td>Davilex Games B.V.</td><td>Racing / Driving</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade</td><td></td><td>Automobile, Street racing, Vehicle simulator</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">London Racer II is another iteration in the prolific Racer series by Davilex.

Each spot consists of a single screen where the player gets to aim where to try his luck. Once the float sits in the water the player has to wait for a fish to bite by watching a close-up picture where any bobs and nibbles can be seen. Once a fish bites, the player has to fight the fish until it's tired enough to give up. This is done by pulling the rod in the opposite direction of where the fish is swimming while keeping an eye on the line tension. If the line tension gets too high or low, the fish will get away. Once the fish's energy bar is sufficiently depleted, it gives up and can be reeled in.The game can be played in two ways; Story Mode or Free Mode. Story Mode follows the main characters from the series through as series of events divided into chapters where fishing, of course, is at the center. Free Mode lets the player fish without the goal oriented story in the way.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">pop'n music 6</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-06-27</td><td>Konami Corporation</td><td>Konami Computer Entertainment Studios, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Music / rhythm</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">pop'n music 6 is one of the many titles in Konami's long-running rhythm game franchise, and the last to appear on the original PlayStation.

Not only do they eat your cheese, but they also destroy your plumbing and attempt to blow up your water tank with high explosives. Frisky Tom is an arcade game which pits you, a plumber named Tom, against a seemingly limitless horde of rodents. Your job is to try and repair all of the damage to the water pipes in the building that is perpetrated by the mice.The game arena is a long and winding pipe which makes its way from a water tank at the top of the screen, down to a collection tank at the bottom. Tom is able to climb up and along the pipes, and between two sections of pipe if the section he is currently clinging to is horizontal. Mice also can run about the maze of pipes, and Tom can swat these to earn points. Some of the mice occasionally turn purple, becoming dangerous to the touch and will often throw themselves kamikaze style directly at Tom, potentially causing the loss of a life.The mice will also occasionally damage the pipes, causing pieces to fall to the ground. If Tom picks these up (he can carry two at a time) and returns them to the damaged location, then that section becomes fixed and the water will flow further along the pipes. If the pipe is completely undamaged, water will be collected in the lower tank, which is worth bonus points when the level is completed.Later in the level, mice will place a bomb at the side of the upper water tank, and other mice will light the fuse. Tom can temporarily stop this by getting above the location of the fire on the fuse and falling off the pipe. As he falls past, his waving arms extinguish the spark on the fuse, delaying the inevitable kaboom. If it is delayed sufficiently, the level will be completed once all of the water has drained from the upper tank. Subsequent levels have exactly the same pipe layout, but faster and more numerous and malicious mice.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Kowai Syasin: Shinrei Syasin Kitan</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-07-25</td><td>Media Entertainment Inc</td><td>Media Entertainment Inc</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td>Horror</td><td>Quick Time Events (QTEs)</td><td>Fantasy, Japan (Modern/Futuristic)</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Kowai Syasin: Shinrei Syasin Kitan is an action game similar to the Fatal Frame series.

All characters are dressed in full kendo armor and your moves are restricted to traditional kendo moves with the bamboo sword. Each character has one harder attack, but otherwise they are all exactly the same in how they play.One clean hit is all it takes to win, so timing your attacking and blocking is important if you want to win.

The new hero is Keith, a young owner of a restaurant in the capital city of Barran. However, he also has a second profession: thief. He only steals from evil people, following the Robin Hood-like tradition of his father, who dedicated years of his life to uncover the secret of a mysterious dungeon known as the Tower of Daidalos. Keith wants to follow in his father's footsteps and to unravel the mystery of the tower. One day he accidentally meets a beautiful young girl who has lost a precious gem. The charmed hero swears he would find it and bring it back. But he doesn't know that the disappearance of the gem is closely connected to the mystery of the Tower of Daidalos...Romance wa Tsurugi no Kagayaki II shares many elements with its predecessor. While the exploration in the game is done in traditional Japanese RPG fashion, the battles resemble those of a turn-based strategy game, since the characters can move on the battle screen and can only attack when enemy is within the range of their weapons. There are no random battles in the game; all the enemies are visible on screen.Like in the first game, the player is able to control the growth of characters, similarly to a Western RPG. Experience points can be accumulated, and leveling up is done manually by the player. Different character classes require different amount of XP to raise a corresponding attribute (for example, it costs less to raise a mage's magic power than stamina).It is possible to imbue weapons with magical items to increase their powers and learn special weapon-related skills. There is also a dating system present in the game. The player can buy items for the female party members to increase their affection, and take them on specific sub-quests. This also influences the ending of the game.Unlike the first game, Romance wa Tsurugi no Kagayaki II contains no nudity or sexual scenes, even though there is plenty of sexual innuendo in conversations and events.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Romance wa Tsurugi no Kagayaki II: Gin no Niji o Sagashite (Genteiban)</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-09-19</td><td>Kadokawa Shoten Publishing Co.

It is a mix of visual novel gameplay, and a character's stats building simulation through various mini-games, except the stats don't affect various girls as in typical love simulation games but how you play tennis. The game lets players name their character and choose whether the protagonist is a boy or a girl. The player then starts as a freshman at Seigaku tennis club and works his or her way up to the top. The game features many key characters from the series and players get to interact with them as well as challenge them in tennis matches. Visual novel gameplay is using typical 1st-person perspective with static background and slightly dynamic character sprites which show minor animations like eye blinking or lip-syncing during dialogues. Key moments are displayed via CG event scenes of higher quality. On-screen text can be toggled off by holding the appropriate button to see clear background image. The game also supports fast-forward option which help player move swiftly though pages and pages of on-screen text and dialogue subtitles. Mini-games show protagonist character in 3rd-person (often but not always) and require player to either mash some button or time button press during QTEs (quick-time events). Game progress is saved at the end of the day when the player is in his or her room, and at the same place choices for what to do the next day or week can be selected. This can vary from studying, cooking, tennis training, part-time working, and other mini-games. The match of tennis is done from a side perspective with camera scrolling as it follows the ball. The character cannot move around the terrain freely and only needs to hit the ball by pressing the corresponding button at the right time, otherwise the character will swing and miss and the opponent will score a point.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Atari: Anniversary Edition</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-09-27</td><td>Infogrames Interactive, Inc.</td><td>Digital Eclipse Software, Inc.</td><td>Compilation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The Atari Anniversary Edition features 12 classic Atari games, whereby two versions of this game exits.

Tantei Idol: The Jigsaw Puzzle is a jigsaw puzzle game featuring characters from the Manga written by Taku Kitazaki as well as images of Japanese swimsuit model Minato Yamabuki.The game can be played in either an Endless Mode or a Time Attack mode. Regardless of which is chosen, the premise is that of assembling a picture which is first shown whole as a guide, then broken down to individual puzzle pieces. The player controls a cursor to pick up pieces and put them back into place. There are several different styles of pieces chosen at random before the start of the puzzle, such as square blocks, traditional puzzle pieces, zig-zag pieces and more.There is also an image gallery for viewing all of the available images in the game.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Night Raid</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-10-10</td><td>Takumi Corporation</td><td>Takumi Corporation</td><td>Action</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Shooter</td><td>Post-apocalyptic, Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In the year 3309, humanity has been taken over by computers. The planet was mechanized by the main computer Batinbo at the south pole, and it was thought that all organic life on the planet had been wiped out. Humanity's fight, however, was not yet over. 87 years later, a computer in the desert that was once Asia began a program -- a program called "Vector", left by humans just before their extinction, created to restore life to the world. Vector must invade the computer Batinbo, and complete this final mission to revive humanity.Night Raid is a conversion of the 2001 vertical arcade shoot-em-up from Takumi, and has a similar feel to their earlier game Mars Matrix. Like in Mars Matrix, destroyed enemies release pickups, but rather than powering up your weapons they now affect your score multiplier. The multiplier is always slowly counting back to zero, but picking up the Score Items released by enemies will increase it. If a Score Item falls out the bottom of the screen, the multiplier is reduced, and can in fact go into negative, at which point the player will actually lose points for destroying enemies. The score can even go negative, and this is actually a viable method of play as the game will also track the lowest scores in addition to the highest ones.You have a standard shot (upgradable through pickups), bombs (which can also be picked up), and an attack called the "hagu launcher" which makes your ship crash into enemy ships to destroy them, and must be recharged after use. The game has six stages, and includes the original arcade mode as well as a score attack mode.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Shin Kidousenki Gundam W: The Battle</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-10-10</td><td>Bandai Co., Ltd.</td><td>Natsume Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Fighting</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td>Mecha / giant robot</td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Shin Kidousenki Gundam W: The Battle is the 13th entry in the Simple Character 2000 series.

The game is divided in several stages. Each stage is timed and she needs to deliver mail to all the mailboxes and find the exit before the timer hits zero.Instead of having the player control Akane herself, the player spins the entire stage around. If the ground is tilted enough, Akane will start walking in the direction the slope is. If it tilts even further she'll start running, a technique that needs to be used to take down obstacles that get in the way, such as vending machines. The stage needs to be tilted around completely to get some of the mailboxes, as they sit both on the ground and in the ceiling as well as on the walls.There are also scattered bonuses to pick up to increase Akane's score and earn extra lives like coins, lucky cats and more.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Mobile Tomodachi</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-10-17</td><td>HAMSTER Corporation</td><td>Atelier Double Co.

The result is an adventure through ten different locales linked together by the swamp. Players guide Shrek from a third-person perspective as they avoid mischievous swamp critters trying to stun them. Each area contains a mini-game that will reveal one of the lost picnic items once completed. The catch? Shrek must first collect a specific number of items to gain access to the mini-game. Once he finds the items, which range in type from pumpkins to candy, Shrek will be able to compete in an assortment of activities. Tug of War has players pressing the directional pad to move a casket, while Cotton Candy has the ogre swinging his confection in the air to trap six flies. Catch Some Weed Rats involves stomping on ten vermin, and Collect the Armor is a race to gather seven pieces of armor while avoiding the Dragon. Swamp Fishing has players reeling in four fish, while Catch the Three Blind Mice is another pattern matching game. Catch the Worms involves grabbing ten squiggling annelids, Cross the Rope Bridge consists of jumping over gaps while avoiding fireballs, Knights' Stand has players tossing tomatoes to score ten points, and Swing on Chains has the ogre moving from one chain to the next until he reaches the exit. Once players complete each of the ten activities, Shrek and Princess Fiona will finally be able to have their picnic. Two difficulty levels are available, Easy and Hard, with the latter causing Shrek to lose items each time he is hit by a swamp critter. Progress during the hunt can be saved to a memory card.

The game's objective is to win the race, of course, but your opponent will try everything in their power to keep your chosen character from winning by sending you off the racetrack. To achieve this they resort to things like weights, water bombs, chewing gum, sudden holes in the road, boards larded with nails or even rockets. But the player can also find these so called power-ups, small packages that can be found at random order on the racetrack. Unfortunately, you do not know what is in the packages until they are opened which adds a little surprise to the action.The kart is controlled using the arrow keys on the keyboard, but one can also use a Windows compatible gamepad.The XL version lacks the Duel mode and two courses.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Disney's Winnie the Pooh: Kindergarten</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-11-05</td><td>BAM!

Some parts of all these titles, such as the introduction look the same.The signing in post is also the place where players and other interested parties can see progress and print off certificates. The first time the player signs in they will see a scene showing Christopher Robin leaving for school, "I Wish I could go to school" says Pooh sadly, "Well why don't we have a school in the hundred acre wood" replies Piglet. Owl says he thinks it's a splendid idea and claims it as his own. After this the player is presented with a map of the hundred acre wood which will be their starting point on future sessions. The activities shown on the map are;
Printing: Here the player can print name tags, book marks and worksheets etc
Musical Mix & Match: The player is presented with two groups of instruments. They select one from the four on the left and one from the four on the right. These combine in the centre to make a new instrument which the player can play by clicking on the keys/strings. There are icons along the bottom of the screen to play a backing track - just one available, record, playback, save and play a saved tune
Number Balloons: Roo's game resembles a fairground side show, it has a striped roof and at the top of the screen running left to right are the numbers one to twenty - one number per stripe. Roo releases a random number of balloons and the player must click on each balloon once until all are counted, the balloons can be clicked in any order but all of them must be clicked. Then the player selects the number from the awning that corresponds to the number of balloons displayed. When the get the answer correct they can/must pop all the balloons and the process repeats
Thoughtful Place: Pooh is in the woods, he's at a place that's not quite a Thoughtful Place yet so making it one is the player's task. To achieve this they use the icons along the bottom of the screen one changes the sky, another changes the scenery, one changes the season, another adds music - just the one track, then items such as logs, trees, ponds, flowers can be added while another button makes any selected object larger or smaller. There are also icons to delete an object, wipe the whole scene, plus save/load icons
Treasure Hunt: This gets the player familiar with maps and directions. On the right is a map with an overlaid grid, Tigger appears here usually somewhere near the middle. On the left is a smaller grid and beneath it is a compass, instructions appear in the small grid such as 'South to tree' and the player must click South on the compass to move Tigger around the map. This continues until he finds the treasure.
Word Shop: Owls library was disturbed by a strong wind and he needs help to put pages back into his book. On the easy setting the player is shown a book with, say, a 'K' on the left and across the top of the screen will be three pictures one of which will have the word 'King' and the picture of a King on it. These match so the player clicks on the picture, drags it to the right hand page of the book and continues. On the harder settings the book will have a picture of a king and across the top of the screen will be three pages one of which will just bear the word 'King'
Shape Sorting: This is Rabbit's game and it is basically two shelves with an assortment of three shapes, on the easy setting each shape is a different colour, on the top and three bottles below. The object is to put the right shape into the right bottle. If the player clicks on the bottle they will hear 'This is a rectangle' or whatever is appropriate
All games have three difficulty settings and odd animations that pop up, apparently at random, to pique the player's interest. When the player completes a game they earn a star, there are fourteen stars in all and there's a certificate that can be printed out.

Waking up from a nap in the Hundred Acre Wood, a puzzled Winnie the Pooh has the feeling he's forgotten something important and somehow arrives at the idea that it must be Eeyore's birthday. The player follows Pooh in his journey around the Wood to spread the news, dropping in on Kanga, Tigger, Owl, Piglet and Rabbit and helping them prepare a party through various activities and minigames.

The chart describes the skills covered by each activity, which include letter recognition, sequencing, same/different, auditory discrimination, color theory, number recognition and counting, among others.From the map, players can also access Pooh's Print 'n' Learn which is a large collection of print projects - stickers, flash cards, bookmarks, ID cards, and an entire printable workbook that builds on the skills covered in the game.

It is said that there is a treasure hidden somewhere in the mansion. As the inheritor of the mansion, Pink set out to find the treasure as soon as he steps into the mansion. He soon finds out that the treasure is locked inside a safe; the keys of which can be obtained by exploring the "rooms" (probably the places/enemies that Uncle Pink previously explored/defeated) in the mansion. Now it up to Pink Panther to retrieve all the keys to the treasure!The main objective of all the levels in the game (except the final level) is to collect the key hidden in each level and get to the goal to proceed to the next level. There are a total of 12 "rooms" (levels) within 3 game modes: platform, race and boss fight. Most levels are in platform mode. In platform mode, the key is guarded by a certain character in a certain place. The way to that place is not straightforward: there are plenty more characters blocking the ways each time players proceed. The only way to proceed is to do the suitable exchanges with these characters (what they need will be displayed in the thought bubbles when players come near them). Very often the object a character needs is also the one another has, so stealing and chasing are essential parts of this mode. Hiding spots are provided for players for convenience during chase sequences. In race mode, Pink's controls are restricted: he cannot freely walk; he can only accelerate or decelerate while moving forward. The key will be obtained once players get to the goal. In boss fight mode, players' only objective is to defeat the boss to get the key. Various enemies are presented in platform mode and race mode, but only in platform mode can players beat the enemies. At the beginning of the game, players is provided with a key to open the first "room". The higher the level is, the greater number of keys is needed. Coins are presented in all levels. Players can collect coins to unlock artworks in the gallery opposite the mansion There are some question mark signs which will summon Uncle Pink to explain new things for players when players stand near them.The graphics are in 3D. Players have a choice among English, France, German, Spanish and Italian. The game is automatically saved when a level is completed or manually by pressing the certain button (can be set in the option section). After completing a level, players can freely choose to replay that level or the lower levels.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-11-15</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Argonaut Games PLC</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">From Argonaut, developers of the first Harry Potter game for PlayStation, comes the sequel, with mostly the same gameplay style and mechanics.

Players control a moving paddle (a tail-swinging kitty in this case) to bounce balls and break gems lined along the upper area of the play field.There are ten worlds with ten levels in each. Worlds include air, seas, rivers, forests, and castles, which primarily just changes the background art. Players are granted score multipliers for hitting gems in quick succession, and lose a "life" if the ball falls past the paddle and off the screen. The end of each world is a boss battle, where the player must bounce the ball off the boss' weak spot while avoiding attacks. Two players can also team up, or challenge each other in split-screen Battle Mode.In addition to points, the player builds up MP through smashing gems and collecting items that fall out. In addition to collecting and activating powerups during play, the player uses MP to purchase powerups at the start of each level. Powerups include multiball, piercing ball, wider paddle, and a comically enormous ball. Graphical effects are used during the boss battles, and with some powerups, to generate snow, stretch the screen, and otherwise bring life to the play fields.High scores are saved, but progress within the worlds is not. However, the first level of each of the ten worlds is always available at the start.

The goal is to destroy the opponent's castle (or something else, as described in the mission briefing). To accomplish your mission, you have no armies to command - your only weapons are ballistic: cannons, catapults and the like. It is also possible to use a bomber airship and some magic effects.Everything takes place in a 3D environment. You can build your own castle and its surroundings such as peasant huts and smithies,where weapons can be placed. These things cost gold, and you get gold by collecting taxes from the peasants. To destroy the opponent's castle, you use your guns and catapults. It is impossible to see in advance where the shot will land, so you need to shoot the target more than once to be more precise. You can have multiple guns and switch between them to bombard your enemy with heavy stones, cannonballs, etc. You can upgrade these weapons to become even more deadly. However, these weapons cannot be fired all the time - they need time to reload and every shot needs to be paid for.Meanwhile, the opponent shoots at your settlement, trying to cut you short of peasants so you cannot buy anything. To hinder him, you can use wizards, which are able to summon sandstorms and rain, obstructing the opponent's sight and targeting. The game supports multiplayer and hot-seat mode up to four players at once.

It hit the Japanese arcade in 1994 and was followed by a Japanese release to the Saturn and the Playstation in the following year.The game is set in a fantasy setting with steampunk elements. Lush forests and medieval castles meet steam trains and mech robots. Instead of piloting the genre-traditional space ships, Gunbird lets the player chose between five different characters (Ash, Marion, Valnus, Yuan Nang and Tetsu) who traverse the game world on broomstick, jet packs and pedal-powered helicopters on a quest to find the pieces of a magic mirror across seven stages. Unorthodox vehicles aside, the gameplay follows traditional genre standards. The main goal is to dodge all bullets that fill the screen while collecting power-ups to make the character stronger. Gunbird features one power-up that incrementally increases the firepower of the standard weapon (P-items) as well as additional ammo for the screen-clearing special ability (B-items). Standard weapon and special ability differ from character to character.

He swallows it and starts to attract metallic objects and creatures. This upsets the balance of the world, and evil creatures start to appear throughout the land. Phix must travel to five realms in order to bring the stone to its original place and return peace.Phix: The Adventure is a 3D platform with a magnetic element similar to the earlier Super Magnetic Neo. The main character attracts or repels objects and enemies by switching polarity (between north and south with the ▲ button). Touching the enemy decreases the number of hearts at the left bottom of the screen. Falling on pits or water kills Phix instantaneously. The ● button shoots magnetic particles (enemies can be killed by particles of opposite polarity: north enemies are affected by south particles, and vice-versa). Pressing and holding the ■ activates a neutral field that lasts some seconds and shields Phix from the magnetic activity around him. The X button makes the character jump. To reach higher places, Phix first must connect to magnetic spots on the ground by selecting the opposite polarity and then switch to the same polarity. Activating the neutral field at this exact moment makes him jump even higher.The game has five worlds, each with three regular levels and a boss stage. It starts with two lives and a timer for each level (the character dies when it runs out), and allows progress to be saved to the memory card.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Rescue Copter</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003</td><td>Conspiracy Entertainment Corp., Crave Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Aqua System Co., Ltd.</td><td>Simulation</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Helicopter, Vehicle simulator</td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">PlayStation Store Description (from Ad Blurbs)Jet CopterX is a helicopter action game that provides the realest thrill of controlling a helicopter.

A block can be grabbed by standing on top of it and rolled in either direction. If the touching faces of two blocks share the same color when the block is released, they are matched and create more blocks for use in building the tower. There are also some blocks which have no color at all, and cannot be matched, as well as blocks with a rotating arrow on them, and can only be rolled in one direction. A block can be rolled up one level on top of another block, as long as there is open space next to it for the block to get to speed.A time limit is imposed by the "borderline" which creeps up the tower. The borderline moves up one level every so often, and if it reaches the lowest incomplete level of the tower, the game is over. The borderline can be slowed by quickly matching blocks and maintaining a combo. Large combos also create additional new blocks when they are completed, making them essential on the more advanced levels.There is also a puzzle mode where a preset assortment of blocks must have all of their faces cleared within a set number of steps.

The player controls an operative of a counter-terrorist force on a mission around the globe to stop terrorist activity and arrest its leaders. The digital pad moves the character, while the B button shoots the weapon and the A button makes the character jump. The character can't shoot downwards. The L trigger cycles through the inventory (displayed on the top-left corner of the screen) and the R trigger throws grenades (when they are available). By selecting an ammunition type, the character uses the corresponding weapon (gas canisters for the flamethrower, machine gun pents for that weapon, etc). The default rifle has an infinite number of bullets. Other items include a grappling rope and a pair of handcuffs to arrest surrended enemies. Ammunition and health packs are scattered throughout the levels, as are proximity mines and assorted enemies.The regular gameplay is occasionally broke by mini-games and entirely different sections: when the character collides with a reticule placard, the game switches to a first-person shooting gallery where the player has to shoot down a certain number of terrorists and rescue the hostages. When colliding with a parachute, two gauges with a red line on the middle appear on the screen. The one on the left measures the position of the falling character and the one on the right measures height. The character must be guided to the right spot, and the shooting button must be pressed when both gauges reach the red bar. Some mission stages change the game to a vertical shooter that recalls Tiger-Heli and similar games, where the player controls a helicopter viewed from the top.The game has 4 missions, each with its own theme: snow mountain, desert, jungle and a city. A password system is provided  (the password is displayed after the completion of every mission).</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Street Racquetball</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-01-01</td><td>Agetec, Inc.</td><td>Highwaystar Co., Ltd.</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Real-time</td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Enter the exciting world of racquetball with this game.

The race plays out as a 2D side scrolling affair along stages with varying degrees of terrain to tackle, while at the same time avoiding rockets, machinegun fire and punches from the other Walkers. If a Walker gets enough hits, it falls over and is immobile for a short time, allowing other participants to pass and gain a better position in the races. Each of the Walkers also have jet thrusters for an additional aerial speed boost, which comes in handy when avoiding fire or scaling rough terrain.

Grudges and alliances are tracked throughout your career, so the more you piss someone off, the more likely they'll try to harm you.Like the Football Camp mode in Madden NFL 2004, the Speed Zone is comprised of different many games that will earn you points and increase your skill, such as passing and drafting, blocking and drifting.With the Career mode, you can go through a full twenty seasons before having to retire.  You manage everything, from your pit crew and car parts to your sponsors and research and development.There are seventy officially licensed drivers and over 180 vehicle skins.  If nothing suits you, create your own driver and car and see how you do.As in every 2004 edition of EA Sports console games, you'll find the EA Sports Bio, which is a career tracker that tracks your stats over every EA Sports game.  The more games you play and the longer you play, the higher your level and the more rewards you can unlock.Tune your car right and drive like a pro, and you may just make it to the finish line.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">CT Special Forces: Back in the Trenches</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-10-01</td><td>Flashpoint AG</td><td>Light & Shadow Production</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person, Side view, Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Platform, Shooter</td><td></td><td>Helicopter</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">CT Special Forces: Back to Hell is the sequel to CT Special Forces and the story picks up right where the last game ended. Having destroyed the terrorist group Network the CT Special Forces are going back to do training missions, but more and more reports about new terror threats keep popping up. Could this be a new terrorist organization, or maybe Network is back for a second round? It's up to the CT Special Forces to stop the treat of terrorism once again!The game plays in 5 different game modes. The majority is made up of side scrolling platform action, somewhat similar to the Metal Slug games, where you pick up various weapons, grenades and even a tank to squash the terrorist threat. Every now and then you'll come across a wooden sign with a cross-hair on it. Doing so will change the game into first person view, where you have to shoot terrorists and save hostages. Sometimes you'll find a parachute pack, and you'll have to play a mini game where you have to make two meters align to make a drop successfully with your parachute.There are also two kinds of helicopter stages. One is a top down shoot'em up, where you have to bomb land targets and gun down enemy helicopters. The other one is a side scrolling chopper rescue game, where you have to save hostages and bring them to your base, while gunning down enemies across the stage.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Baldies</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-10-03</td><td>Mud Duck Productions</td><td>Creative Edge Software</td><td>Strategy</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Real-time strategy</td><td></td><td></td><td>Multiple units/characters control, Point and select</td><td>Real-time</td><td>Everyone</td><td>Free-roaming camera</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The premise of Baldies is similar to many real-time strategy games.

When your brothers and sisters are dognapped by Cruella De Vil, you team up with Patch's favorite TV star Thunderbolt in an effort to rescue them.Gameplay is fairly basic for a 3-D platformer.

The graphics and sounds were upgraded, but the basic gameplay remains the same, with the player controlling a tiny ship moving over a green contour line. The thin line is drawn over the edges of the screen, framing the game field. The ship acts as a cursor and has to be used to draw a square or rectangular extension into the field, thus removing it and slowly decreasing the size of the available space. Enemies roam each level, moving in random patterns around the screen but always following the movements of the cursor. The ship has a force-field shield around it, and only becomes vulnerable when drawing new lines.The player has to quickly close the sections, timing it correctly to avoid collision with any of the foes or their projectiles. The enemies can be eliminated by connecting a section where they are standing, or by using one of the power-ups. The power-ups are stored inside boxes, that in some levels keep appearing and disappearing, and can be collected by removing a section with one of them inside. Most of the powers are temporary, giving lasers to destroy the smaller aliens, freezing the enemies for a few seconds, increasing the speed of the ship and helping in other ways. Each level is finished after removing at least 70% of the field, or if the large boss monster that shoots at random intervals is killed in some way. A port of the original game is also included, using the old assets but with a horizontal orientation.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">FIFA Soccer 2004</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-11-04</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Electronic Arts Canada, NuFX, Inc. </td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other), Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The FIFA series returns for another season to the original PlayStation with FIFA Soccer 2004.

Points are awarded for accuracy with extras for making certain 'combos' (mini-routines within a song which are deemed especially difficult or long).The original game PS1 version of the game had twenty tracks, this game has just twelve. It can be played in either Aerobic mode, which calculates but does not record the number of calories you've burnt during play, or Dance mode.Dance mode can be played in head-to-head, multiplayer or jukebox modes and has four three difficulty levels, beginner, easy, medium and expert. Head to head requires two controllers while the other two require just the one. 
In all modes the player can either select the track they wish to dance to or let the game select a random track, jukebox mode also has a dance recorder function, which does not have to be unlocked as it did in Dance:UK, but when the player dances to the playback the score is not recorded in the high score table.Though the game is intended to be used with a dance mat it can be played using a standard controller. There is an optional karaoke feature which shows the words of the song while the player is dancing, the words do not show during the dance recording or playback features.

These are:
Wild West
War Drones
Space Rebellion
G Squad
IF22
Ace
Air RescueThough listed as 7 different games, in fact the games are mostly reskinned versions of each other. They all feature the same premise: Take down a certain number of enemies to advance to the next stage. Each game has its own main menu, although it only features three options: New Game, High Score, and Main Menu (which takes you back to the game selection screen).Wild West and Ace (while graphically different) has the player assume the role of a single character in the foreground seen from behind. The Mission (as in all games on the disc) is to kill a certain number of bad guys per stage to advance. The character can walk sideways or roll, and the game utilizes a Cabal style aiming system. Meaning that you move the aim as well as the character with the directional pad. There are also a few bonuses such as heavier weapons and bonus points to pick up.G Squad has the player pilot a big mech robot. The only freedom of movement is strafing sideways to the left or right and some slight movement up and down. Aside from that the player controls the aim and can select from three different weapons to take down enemies with. There are also bonuses, such as ammo, extra points and fuel.War Drones, Space Rebellion, IF22 and Air Rescue are all variants of the same theme. The player controls an airborne machine (airplane, jetfighter, mecha or spaceship, depending on the game), and takes down enemies in a similar fashion to the arcade classic Afterburner. There are two types of weapons to use: either a light rapid firing weapon (machine gun or laser, depending on the game) and rockets which are somewhat heat seeking. There are some bonuses, such as more ammo, extra points and fuel to pick up along the way.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Schnappi: 3 Fun-Games</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-03-01</td><td>phenomedia publishing gmbh</td><td>Sproing Interactive Media GmbH</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Schnappi is a character out of an extremely successful German music clip and pop song called "Schnappi, das kleine Krokodil" (Schnappi, the little crocodile).

The player must help Yopaz, a spheric small character, in its task to collect all the stars in the universe.The only possible action is pushing Yopaz to one of the four cardinal directions: owing to the absence of gravity, it won't stop until coming in contact with the borders, or an obstacle. There are three sets of levels. 'Classic' and 'Tiny' are differentiated by the game area size. In 'Advanced' levels Yopaz needs to collect stars of different colours, and since it can only collect stars of its own colour, it needs to reach alight triangles on some blocks, that will turn its colour into theirs; elements such as teleporters and objects — still and moving —, fatal if coming in contact with, are also introduced.There is the possibility to view online leaderboards, the score consisting in the time taken to complete levels.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Zia and the Goddesses of Magic</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2016-08-01</td><td>OrionSoft</td><td>OrionSoft</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td>Real-time</td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>PS1</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Steam Store description (from Ad Blurbs)In a world where magic is Queen, people lived happily and safely under the protection of the ten guardian goddesses.
