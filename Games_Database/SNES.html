Those are important because every part of the car has only a limited durability and it may be needed to repair them during a race stage. if the parts are not available right away, the player has to take a major hit on the time limit. Repairs can also be conducted between the single race stages. Another aspect that needs to be calculated in is the weight of the spare parts: the more parts in the car, the lesser the maximum speed.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Harukanaru Augusta</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1991-04-05</td><td>T&E Soft, Inc.</td><td>T&E Soft, Inc.</td><td>Sports</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Harukanaru Augusta is a golf game which allows the player to participate in a tournament on the Augusta National course.

The player chooses one of the four available hovercars and then can race with other hovercars in one of the gameplay modes - "Practice" or "Grand Prix". In "Practice" mode, the player chooses one track where he competes with one other hovercar to win the race (or there can be no rival at all, if you so wish). In "Grand Prix", the player must complete a series of races with several competitors. Each race consists of five laps. The hovercar has a limited Power meter, which represents the machine's health and decreases when the hovercar collides with the track boundaries and other players. If power runs out, the hovercar explodes and the player loses the race. There are repair areas near the start line, which restore power to the player's hovercar if he drives into them. The tracks contain many more or less dangerous traps, such as icefields or landmines. Completing a lap awards the player a "Super Jet" which can be activated at any time to give a short speed boost. The hovercar can keep up to three Super Jets and use them when necessary. Completing a lap also gives points, which give the player a life when enough are accumulated. The player can lose a life in the Grand Prix mode if his hovercar explodes, if his hovercar somehow falls out of the track or if he ends up too far behind the other racers. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Pilotwings</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1991-08-01</td><td>Nintendo of America Inc.</td><td>Nintendo Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action, Simulation</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Flight / aviation, Vehicle simulator</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Fly a selection of aircraft (including training vehicles, fighter planes and helicopters) through a range of training programs and missions.

Darius Twin is a side scrolling shooter similar to other games in the Darius series. You'll fly through a series of different stages, each with numerous enemies and ending with a large boss. You begin the game with a limited amount of fire power, but after shooting certain enemies power ups are left behind to increase your capabilities. Unlike many of the Darius games, if your ship is destroyed you don't lose all of the weapons you've collected; likewise you also continue on at the same point rather than being sent back to a checkpoint. Similar to many of the Darius games there are different routes that can be taken towards the final stage. At the end of each stage, you are shown a map and can select the next stage you would like to complete. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Final Fantasy II</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1991-11-01</td><td>Square Soft, Inc.</td><td>Square Co., Ltd.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Japanese-style RPG (JRPG)</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td>Direct control, Menu structures</td><td>Real-time, Turn-based</td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The military country of Baron is one of the strongest in the land, with a proud army and a majestic air force known as the Red Wings. However, the recent actions of the king make even the most loyal of his subordinates doubt his judgment. The captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to attack the city of Mysidia and take the Water Crystal from innocent magicians who protect it. When Cecil questions the king's orders, he is immediately thrown out of the country and sent off to deliver a package to the village of Mist, accompanied by his best friend Kain, the captain of the dragoons. Little does he realize that the king's inexplicable behavior is but a part of a much larger picture, which he is yet to reveal.The fourth entry in the Final Fantasy series was released as Final Fantasy II in the West, because the second and the third games were not released there at the time. The game is a Japanese-style RPG with top-down world map navigation, automatic leveling up, and random enemy encounters.The game introduces a system called ATB (active-time battle). While combat is turn-based in its core, the game does not pause when the player accesses the battle menu. Enemies continue to act in real time regardless of the actions of the player-controlled party. The turns of the participants are calculated depending on their agility rating. Each player-controlled character has a special bar that gradually refills itself; said character may act when the bar is full.Unlike all the previous Final Fantasy games, the fourth installment does not allow the player to customize the characters' abilities and classes. Each character belongs to a specific, clearly defined class: dragoon, white mage, black mage, summoner, ninja, etc. Each of these classes has distinct special abilities or magic spells. New abilities are learned automatically when a character reaches a pre-determined level. Characters join and leave the party as dictated by the game's plot events. The active party includes up to five combatants.The PlayStation version adds a new rendered intro and ending.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">HyperZone</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1991-11-01</td><td>HAL America Inc.</td><td>HAL Laboratory, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Rail shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td>Flight / aviation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">A 3D shooter similar to Space Harrier.

Pro-Am in 1988 and Electronic Art's Racing Destruction Set in 1985, with the latter being the larger influence. It is a precursor to Rock 'n Roll Racing, which was done by the same developer.Combat, obstacles, and traction on the non-flat tracks play a significant role. There are 3 vehicle types to choose from that perform differently on pavement, dirt, ice, flat or bumpy tracks. Cars can be armed with oil, nitro, and mines. Additionally, there are 3 levels of tires, engines, shocks, and armor.There are full race season, single race, and custom track modes. In 1 player games, the 2nd player is replaced with one of 8 AI opponents who are each associated with their own vehicle. There are 128 total tracks in this game.In season mode, each track has an entrance fee and cash prize for placing 1st; often lesser cash prizes for lesser placements are also awarded. For an additional fee, racers can opt to move to a higher racing class (levels) where fees and prizes are bigger. Each class has its own set of tracks that the player may choose from. No track is mandatory or unavailable within a class. The player also has the option of going back to a lower class for free, which may become necessary if funds are eaten up be fees without winning prizes. However, going up always incurs a fee, even if the player has been there before.During custom track designing, players can set the track's laps, gravity, and starting line type. Each track section can be pavement, dirt, or ice. Track sections are laid out like puzzle pieces on a 2D non-isometric grid (Pipe-Mania style). Sections include horizontal and vertical straights, four standard 90¬∞ turns, eight T-sections for diverging and converging multiple paths in any direction, and a criss-cross. Either a horizontal or vertical special straight section is used as the starting grid. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Super Tennis</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1991-11-01</td><td>Nintendo of America Inc.</td><td>Tokyo Shoseki Co., Ltd.</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The world circuit of tennis awaits you.

Set in the year 1691, the game casts the player in the role of Simon Belmont, a vampire hunter armed with a powerful whip, on a quest to defeat the evil Count Dracula in his castle. Despite the identical plot, the six castle stages have different layouts and themes; also, five initial stages that depict Simon's advancement towards the castle through various environments have been added.The gameplay consists of traversing timed, linear platform stages, defeating enemies with the whip or sub-weapons that require collecting hearts and can be found by destroying parts of the scenery. Simon's stand-out ability in this installment are eight-directional attacks with his whip, which allow him, among others, to damage enemies standing below and above him. Holding out the whip will block enemy attacks. Simon can also latch his whip on special grappling points to swing over pits and obstacles.

TriviaBody Boarding
If more than one player is competing on the Body-Boarding event, one of them is in for a bad surprise: once the character jumps off the deck, he'll be eaten by a shark (just like the Jaws movie poster). Of course he doesn't die, it's just a prank!Related Web Sites IGCD Internet Game Cars Database (Game page on IGCD, a database that tries to archive vehicles found in video games.)

The standard punch is a cross, but by holding the Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown.By avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch often becomes available, inflicting much more damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three rounds of three minutes each. When a boxer is knocked down four times, the match is over (technical knock-out). The same happens when a boxer goes down three times in a single round (regular knock-out). When down, players need to press both punch buttons in rapid succession to get back to their feet. The screen shows an energy meter drained when punches are received. After being knocked down and during intermissions, some energy is restored.All versions, except for the Game Boy, can be played with two players. A password system is used to save the progress.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Goal!</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1992</td><td>Jaleco USA, Inc.</td><td>Tose Co., Ltd.</td><td>Sports</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Goal! is a soccer game featuring an Exhibition mode and a Super Cup mode.

He's also kidnapped Mario, hence the title of this game. You play as Luigi who must foil Bowser's plans by entering through each of the portals, tracking down the Koopas who have stolen famous artifacts, and looking for clues about your location. Once you've set everything right and determined where you are, you call Yoshi on your Globulator so he can track you down. You need Yoshi's help to eat the Pokey (a cactus-like creature) that's guarding the return portal, and when Luigi returns he can close the portal forever.By exploring these 25 cities, children can familiarize themselves with the landmarks and artifacts that each city has.

Any number of positions can be taken over by computer opponents. The game comes with eight different opponents, which are selected from a portrait gallery (8- and 16-bit versions feature different names and portraits).It is possible to set up a time limit for a game, and also to customize the game. Amount of starting money, owned properties, houses and hotels can be set for any player before starting. The game also comes with a number of preset scenarios with varied starting parameters. The 8-bit versions have eight scenarios, the 16-bit versions add another four. The Game Boy versions also feature the scenarios, but don't have the customization option.During gameplay, the board is seen from the top. Moving tokens are displayed in a special animation in the center of the board, as is a hand throwing the dice.

Marble Madness explores this theme in a fudged 3-D perspective, Cloud Kingdoms in a flat 2-D one -- both by directly influencing the actions of the ball.  The game takes a different approach toward a similar end; instead of moving the ball around the board, you move the board around the ball.That's right; from the get-go, gravity pulls ever down, down, down on your ball toward the bottom of your screen regardless of board orientation; the task of the player is to rotate the board now clockwise, now counter-clockwise, to further a timely and unobstructed path beneath the ball in its progress toward each level's goal before the timer ticks down to zero.  The game might as well have been named "inertia."  Many obstacles can be avoided, but some must be engaged head-on: a certain momentum, if not terminal velocity, must be achieved to break through crumbling brick barriers; other obstacles toggle on and off like traffic lights, demanding not only speed but timing.  Some influence the ball's direction, and in addition to merely delaying the ball's progress, touching some impediments incurs an additional time penalty -- conversely, some blocks bestow time bonuses, if you can afford the ever-diminishing time needed to take the scenic detour and collect them.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">PGA Tour Golf</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1992</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Sterling Silver Software</td><td>Sports</td><td>Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">PGA Tour Golf introduced many of the conventions commonly seen in the genre since. The three-click control method (the first to start the swing, the second setting power and over-swing, the third setting draw or fade) allowed for a multitude of different shots, and required a sense of timing. Four courses are included, one of them a fantasy 'links' course designed by the programmers. Some of the holes are fiendish, with bunkers, water hazards and trees, and the need to plan strategies to get the best approach to the green.When playing a tournament there are 60 opponents, each representing top US golfers - ten of these appear in the game, with one providing tactical advice for each hole.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Parodius</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1992</td><td>Konami Co., Ltd.</td><td>Konami Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td>Regional differences</td><td>Comedy</td><td>Arcade, Shooter</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This is mostly the parody of Gradius (Nemesis on some systems), with some flavor from other shoot-em-ups, like Twinbee.

These eighteen-holes demand accuracy, finesse, and even at times brute strength. The famous beach-side course is littered with sand-bunkers as well as sweeping fairways and cliff-side greens. Game play takes a classic approach - players control a selected golfer from a third-person perspective. Swing-control is displayed as a power and accuracy meter with which players must start and stop accordingly. Again, the classic-style putting system, complete with a topographic grid, lets the player know of the slope and elevation of the three-dimensional putting surface.As there are no other courses to play, this game is a tribute and testament to the challenging course-design of Pebble Beach Golf Links.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Push-Over</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1992</td><td>Ocean Software Ltd.</td><td>Red Rat Software Ltd</td><td>Action, Puzzle</td><td>Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">You're playing a small ant that is willing to help a friend in a rather inconvenient situation. Apparently, the Quavers mascot Colin Curly likes his Quavers so much he lost balance and dropped them down a giant ant-hill. It's now your job to go in, in a mission to solve puzzles and retrieve the snacks for your friend.Now, this ant-hill is a bit different from the ones you saw, and especially from the one you live in. Its path is filled with domino-like tiles and closed gates that must get through to find the snacks. You'll have to traverse different themed worlds in order to retrieve Colin's precious Quavers.The main game consists in controlling the ant from a standard third-person platformer perspective and moving dominoes to place them in a well imagined line, so that when you push the correct one, all of them fall with a specifically marked tile falling last. The door will otherwise stay shut and you will be unable to progress. In addition to that, your ant can't fall from too high or it will die and make you restart the level.Every domino tile has its own marking. For example, yellow ones are the ones you simply push in a direction so they push the one next to them, most often in a chain reaction. Red ones, on the contrary, can't be pushed at all (but can be moved) and tiles that hit it will fall back in the opposite direction. Other types of tiles include one that explodes when being pushed or hit by another tile, clearing the way for other tiles; one that keeps moving ahead until it hits another tile; one that creates a bridge over a gap; or one that moves straight up and stick to the ceiling, pushing a tile next to it.Each level is timed and requires quick thinking in order to be completed successfully. Upon completion of a level, the player is given a password that can be used to resume the game at the level they last left off.The SNES version doesn't have the Quavers branding and involves retrieving drops of cash for a rat character instead.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Q*bert 3</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1992</td><td>NTV International Corporation</td><td>Ironwind Software, Realtime Associates, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Platform, Puzzle elements</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen, Isometric</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This game is based on the coin-op of the early 80's.

Now he must fight for his life and ultimately to free the Westican people.Sk√ºljagger: Revolt of the Westicans is a sidescrolling platform game. Players select between a 1 player game, an alternating turn 2 player game or Bubblegum Practice. The player controls Storm Jaxon who is able to run left and right, jump and swing Sk√ºljagger's magic sword. Storm must reach the end of each level before time runs out or risk losing a life. Under normal circumstances, touching an enemy or projectile will cause him to die, though the sword is often able to destroy projectiles. By collecting red jewels, Storm is able to both augment the sword with a projectile attack and be protected from one enemy attack. Green jewels will also protect from one enemy attack, however collecting 25 of them will grant an extra life. Blue jewels add additional time for Storm to complete each level. Finding a mask will make Storm invulnerable for a short time. These power-ups are either floating in the air of each level or hidden away in chests, boxes, rocks and coconuts. However these items which may hide items can also be picked up and thrown at enemies.In addition to the power-ups listed above, fruity bubblegum can also be found. Only one bubble gum flavor can be carried at a time and it will be held until the player activates it. Grape bubblegum encases Storm in a giant invulnerable bubble that can bounce higher than jumping alone. Cherry bubblegum will require the player to inflate manually, but will allow Storm to fly. Beware as over inflating the bubble will pop it. Watermelon bubblegum will turn Storm into a projectile that damages anything on the screen, also gathering items. Orange bubblegum will let Storm spit out pellets at enemies which will destroy them. Bubblegum power-ups can be tested in the special bubblegum practice option of the menu.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">SmartBall</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1992</td><td>Sony Imagesoft</td><td>Game Freak, Inc., System Sacom</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">King Geoffrey of Kyliria has recently passed away.

The hovercraft has the ability to accelerate, reverse, track the hoverball, and it can also fire at the opposing player to make him drop the ball if he's carrying it. If the player's hovercraft picks up the hoverball, they must try to get to the touchdown area within four seconds or else the hoverball gets automatically fumbled. Each game is played for a duration of 500 time units and the player with the highest score when the time runs out is declared the winner.The playfield itself presents features that can affect the way the match is played.

Blastris A is a falling block game based on Tetris and plays very similar. Blocks appear on the left side of the screen and move towards the right side of the screen, where they will fit into play. The goal is to have the blocks on any column line up and destroy themselves. Each level requires five of these to happen. Unlike Tetris, the player cannot move or even rotate blocks. Instead each section of the block can be destroyed by shooting it. Higher difficulty levels increase the speed of gameplay
Blastris B is a falling block game based on Columns and Puyo Puyo. On each screen are a number of "jelly blocks" which must be destroyed to complete the stage. New blocks appear at the top of the screen and move towards the bottom where they fit into play. Blocks can be destroyed by lining up a row of 4 blocks of the same colour. The player is unable to move the falling blocks but may cycle their colour by shooting at them.
Mole Patrol is combination of Whack-a-Mole and a shooting gallery. A number of moles appear on the screen with a flag indicating the amount that need to be destroyed that level, before jumping into a pipe. From there the moles will climb out of any one of 12 holes on the screen and the player must shoot them as fast as possible. Along with regular moles are pink moles that will temporarily speed up gameplay, making shots more difficult.
LazerBlazer Mode feature a group of games set in a military atmosphere.
Type A: Intercept is a first person shooting game where the player shoots down incoming missiles and airplanes. These missiles/planes appear on the right side of the screen and move towards the left side. A radar is also given to the player to keep track of overall positions of these objects on the screen. Ammunition is limited and the player must shoot down a certain amount each level.
Type B: Engage is a first person shooting game where the player shoots down incoming missiles and airplanes, which will cautiously open fire on the player.

A radar is also given to the player to keep track of overall positions of these objects on the screen. Ammunition is limited and the player must shoot down a certain amount each level. 
Type C: Confront is a first person shooting game where the player shoots down incoming spacecraft, which will actively open fire on the player.

Rub-A-Doc visited with some of the other places in the world before departing to the heavens and leaving the world. All seemed peaceful however there seems to be trouble starting up, strange monsters have been seen throughout Chinaland. Could the increase in monsters be somehow related to the recent visit from Rub-A-Doc? The ninja masters of Mount Edin, Jack and Ryu are sent to investigate...Super Ninja Boy is an action RPG for one or two players. In a two player game, each player controls either Jack or Ryu. In a one player game, only Jack appears. A second player may join at any time by visiting a convenience store.The game contains familiar role-playing elements such as equipping differing kinds of weapons, equipment and gaining levels. The Ninja Boys are treated as a single entity and so these statistics are shared between Jack and Ryu with equal values. Battles with the enemy, either through random encounters or visible on the map is where the action starts. The characters enter a side-scrolling 'battle mode' where they may jump, fight, use their special techniques, items and spells, as well as activate various bonuses on the battlefield by breaking open the bonus boxes. A battle is over and experience points awarded when a pre-determined number of enemies are defeated or the Ninja Boys are defeated.When bosses are encountered, the gameplay changes to a turn-based system. Each turn, commands are given to Jack and Ryu, which include usage of special items and skills acquired during the game, who then perform actions based on those commands. The enemy's turn takes place the same way. The battle ends when one side of the conflict runs out of hitpoints.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Super Nintendo Entertainment System: Super Set (included game)</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1992</td><td>Nintendo of Europe GmbH</td><td></td><td>Special edition</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This special edition contains the following:

In the overhead-view villages, enemies must be defeated in order to earn money and other items (which include a weapon-enhancing lucky cat and mystical scrolls). The player is able to attack with their primary weapon and jump. Throwing weapons can also be used, which consume money for each one thrown. Attacking innocent villagers will cause the player to lose money. Money can also be gained (or lost) by visiting one of the numerous mini games, often in houses: which include mazes, whack-a-mole, the lottery, dice, a 3D labyrinth and a game trivia quiz show. Other businesses such as shops, resturants, inns and judo training can also be visited.At the end of each village is an "action area" which changes the game in a complete side-scroller. One or both players can enter this place, filled with obstacles, traps, enemies and a boss creature. In addition to the regular moves used in town, players also gain the ability to unleash one of four special attacks for each character (if bought beforehand at the judo training center). These consume the scrolls collected in order to use.

The middle one, Saruin, was sealed away in the dark world. Now, after thousand years have passed, and the seal of Saruin has weakened, it is time for you, the hero of the new generation, to defeat him.Romancing SaGa is the fourth installment in the long SaGa series - non-linear role-playing games with several main heroes. It is the first of the three SNES (Super Famicom) entries (following the first three games in the series, which were known as  Final Fantasy Legend outside of Japan). In this game, you play the stories of eight characters, which will later unite to face the ultimate evil. The eight characters belong to different classes and have different abilities. There are four male characters (noble son, thief, adventurer, and pirate), and four female ones (nomad, ranger, dancer, and savage). The combat is turn-based, with enemies visible on screen. Taking a cue from the Famicom game Final Fantasy II, instead of "leveling" your character as a whole you level specific abilities such as a type of weapon or magic, as well as, stats such as HP and Strength and Intelligence. New to this entry abilities are randomly unlocked during battle as a light-bulb appears over the characters head and the new ability is unleashed to the surprise of friend and foe. This serendipitous element of gameplay along with the multiple heroes to choose from greatly enhance the replay value as no two playthroughs are alike; the steep learning curve of the SaGa games might require multiple playthroughs to truly master the system.The game was never released outside of Japan until the Playstation 2 remake Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Nolan Ryan's Baseball </td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1992-02-01</td><td>Romstar, Inc.</td><td>Affect Co.,Ltd</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">A baseball game featuring both a pennant race and a single game mode.The pennant race features 12 different teams (6 teams to each league), vying to make it to the All Star final.

The world's most popular television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are filled to bursting with hordes of mindless beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1992-02-14</td><td>Epoch Co., Ltd.</td><td>Nihon Falcom Corp.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>1st-person, Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes tells the story of a young prince named Selios. One day his old teacher Raiyas sends him to a nearby cave to retrieve a magic weapon. When the prince returns, he finds the house attacked by monsters. Raiyas tells him to seek help in the castle of a baron, whose country has always been allies with theirs for a long time. However, the baron betrays Selios' trust and imprisons him. The young prince manages to escape, but without the possibility to return he has no choice but to wander through the land, trying to find trustworthy companions who would help him to save his country.This is a traditional medieval-themed Japanese RPG with turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective (like in  Dragon Warrior games). The enemies are semi-random: they do appear out of nowhere and attack suddenly, but they are visible on the screen, and if you flee from a battle they will still be there to pursue you.

Yuko, the heroine of the three previous Valis games, is no longer a sacred Valis warrior - she has become a goddess. Lena, a young girl who wants to become a Valis warrior, must prove to Yuko she is worthy to wield the sword of Valis, that will eventually stop the evil plans of Gallagher.Super Valis IV is a version of Valis IV. The biggest difference in this release is the omission of the two protagonists Amu and Asfal, both from the story and the gameplay. The player controls only Lena, and all references to the other two pivotal characters are removed. This version also has less stages and less cutscenes than the PCE (TurboGrafx) CD release.There are also significant differences in the gameplay system.

Two commandos, Jimbo and Sully, have come forth now to defeat Red Falcon and save what remains of the world from his hideous plans.The Alien War is the third entry in the Contra series. Like its predecessors, it is a predominantly side-scrolling shooter with a heavy emphasis on action. The protagonist can carry two weapons (as opposed to one in the previous entries), and fire in eight directions when standing still. New abilities include climbing on walls, grabbing poles and navigating tanks. Parts of scenery can be destroyed.In a few instances the protagonist will also participate in motorcycle changes.

When all seemed lost, a mysterious wizard, Agahnim, appeared and stopped these strange happenings from occurring.  But there is talk that Agahnim now rules the country with his magic, behind the scenes.  And then, one night, the Princess of Hyrule, Zelda, calls out for help - and the one who hears her pleas is a young lad named Link.The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past is a top-down action game with puzzle-solving elements (similar to the original Legend of Zelda). Players assume the role of Link, and their goal is to rescue Princess Zelda and save the land of Hyrule.  All combat in the game is action-oriented - the player can make the protagonist swing the sword at enemies with a press of a button, or spin the sword around for a more powerful attack by holding down the button until it is charged.Progression through the game is done by conquering a series of dungeons - each dungeon has its own special item associated with it, such as the hookshot (which latches onto a far-off object and pulls Link across) or the hammer (which can be used to flatten objects in your way).  Most of these dungeons are rendered impassable until the dungeon's particular item is acquired; from there, the rest of the dungeon becomes accessible due to Link's latest new ability.  The bosses of each dungeon are also themed to that level's particular item.Link starts out with only three units of health; however, these can be increased by defeating dungeon bosses, which give one additional heart container, or by finding four 'pieces of heart'; which can be given for anything from passing a small trial to winning a mini-game.  Some of Link's items also use magic - this can be refilled with collectible green magic pots.  After defeating the initial three dungeons, Link gains access to the Dark World - many puzzles and difficulties come from alternating between the Light World (Hyrule) and the Dark World to make his way past previously impassable obstacles.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Top Gear</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1992-04-01</td><td>Kotobuki System Co., Ltd.</td><td>Gremlin Graphics Software Limited</td><td>Action, Racing / Driving</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade</td><td></td><td>Automobile, Track racing, Vehicle simulator</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In the first of three released games for Super NES, players can choose among 4 different cars, each one with different attributes (maximum speed, fuel consumption, boost power and tire grip) to face 32 challenging courses situated in several places around the world as Brazil, USA, France, Japan etc.In more longer tracks, players will find a Pit Stop section, where they can enter to replenish the fuel meter (total or partially).

The game generally follows the movie plot, allowing the player to experience some of the most important sequences, such as the search for Obi-Wan Kenobi, rescuing princess Leia, and the final confrontation against Death Star and its TIE Fighters, led by the mysterious Darth Vader.Most of the game levels follow traditional platform gameplay style. As Luke, Han, or Chewbacca, the player makes his way through the linear levels, fighting enemies, jumping over obstacles, and collecting power-ups. The power-ups include standard health-restoring items, upgrades for the blaster gun (up to five different upgrade levels), as well as special items that can be used for massive destruction of the enemies. Luke uses a weak blaster gun, but later gains access to a lightsaber, being able to fight enemies melee-style. Han and Chewbacca use stronger flame guns, but cannot upgrade to better weapons.Some of the levels are dedicated to familiar Star Wars vehicles (such as a land speeder).

The ruler, King Magridd, struck a deal with the evil Deathtoll - in exchange for the soul of one living being, Deathtoll will give him a piece of gold.  Magridd's greed got the better of him, and, thinking of the millions of souls of every living creature around the world, readily agreed to the deal.  But Magridd himself has since disappeared, and the the land is now devoid of life - instead only filled with Deathtoll's monstrous minions.  Will you be able to save Friel's subjects from their horrible fate?Soul Blazer is an action RPG in the style of The Legend of Zelda.  Like Zelda, battles are not turn-based - the player directly attacks enemies and dodges them.  As they progress, they also unlock special items which allows them to complete tasks for characters or access special areas (such as the Dream Rod, which transports you into someone's - or something's - dream).  Unlike Zelda, the game has an experience meter, and the player levels up and becomes stronger as they defeat enemies.  The game's unique hook is that there are "Monster Lairs" spread all over the land of Friel.  When they destroy all the enemies in a lair, they don't come back, and when they step on the empty lair, it restores part of the game world, bringing back anything from plants, to animals, to people, to buildings and more.  Each restored soul helps in some way - for example, the player can climb regrown ivy to reach new areas, reunite families by bringing back husband and wife, rebuild cities by restoring architects, and talk to characters to complete even more quests.The player's main goal is to find six Stones, which allow them to gain access to the World of Evil, where Deathtoll resides.  These stones are guarded by key characters in different parts of the world, usually the rulers, who require the player to defeat a boss character to rescue them.  While most of the game allows them to progress in a linear fashion, there are certain souls that can only be restored by killing monsters that can't be harmed with their earlier weapons.  The player will need to find special weaponry and then backtrack to previous areas to rescue these souls.  It's also advisable to revisit previous locations, as certain characters may have new sidequests to complete which can reward them with new items to make them even stronger.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Super Play Action Football</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1992-08-01</td><td>Nintendo of America Inc.</td><td>Tose Co., Ltd.</td><td>Sports</td><td>Top-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Isometric</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The 16-bit sequel to NES Play Action Football.

The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap or a piece that the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However, a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels, there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Shodai: Nekketsu K≈çha Kunio-kun</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1992-08-07</td><td>Technos Japan Corp.</td><td>Technos Japan Corp.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Action RPG, Beat 'em up / brawler</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">First next-gen entry in the Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun brawler series.

These special moves can be acquired by collecting special items and your character gains experience for defeating enemies which allows you to upgrade his stats when leveling up. The battles are somewhat more chaotic as they are now staged as distinct waves that must be cleared before you can continue to scroll down the level, in each of these waves you'll face not only opposing gang members, but also neutral characters, policemen and other assorted NPCs that can fight on your side, against you, or simply ignore you depending on your behavior.New features in Shodai-NKKK include branching plot-points that lead you to different challenges and even alternate endings as well as completely reworked graphics to take advantage of the 16-bit SNES which now feature a more realistically proportioned character design.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Super Momotar≈ç Dentetsu II</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1992-08-07</td><td>Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.</td><td>Hudson Soft Company, Ltd., Summer Project</td><td>Strategy</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Board game</td><td>Japan (Modern/Futuristic)</td><td></td><td>Menu structures</td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Super Momotar≈ç Dentetsu ‚Ö° is a financial board game featuring Hudson Soft's interpretation of the folklore hero Momotar≈ç.

Now, without warning, a mechanical moon has appeared in the skies over Mars, and is raining down destruction on the colonies. A plan is hastily put into action to destroy the moon and its armada of space-craft. Due to the impossible task of surviving a direct assault, the mission is code-named Acrobat Mission.Your spaceship in Acrobat Mission is capable of firing a single straight ahead shot. By picking up a Wide upgrade, more shots are added that fly off at an angle, and the shot can be charged up to unleash a continuous short range cone of energy. Picking up a Hurricane upgrade will cause bullets to circle you defensively before shooting forward, and charging will store a full round of bullets up to be fired straight ahead all at once. Up to two bombs can be held at once, and if an enemy bullet hits a bomb it will detonate, saving your ship from damage. If your ship is hit, however, then you will have a few seconds to ram it into whatever shot you and take them down with you. Unlike most scrolling shooter games contact with an enemy ship will not kill you, but they can still push you into the path of bullets.Play takes place over five levels, first of your launch on Mars, then the approach to the moon, and finally infiltrating the base to destroy its core. Each level ends with a unique boss except stage 4, which ends with 3 bosses.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Super Mahjong Taikai</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1992-09-12</td><td>KOEI Co., Ltd.</td><td>KOEI Co., Ltd.</td><td>Strategy</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td>Cards / tiles</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Super Mahjong Taikai is a follow-up to Mahjong Taikai.

Each player's character is armed with a gun, which shoots a vertical cable. If this hits a bubble, it will cause it to split in two. Upgrades allow two cables to be shot at once, or the ability to stick a cable to the ceiling where it will cling for a few seconds, bursting any bubble that hits it.Players must clear each screen of bubbles before progressing to the next one. The largest bubbles will have 4 degrees of splitting before clearing. Many level layouts have ladders, barriers and breakable bricks in part of the screen, affecting movement of both the player and the bubbles. Faster bubbles in the shape of diamonds also bounce around the screen going any which way rather than bouncing in predictable arcs like the other bubbles.Several power-up tokens are also available, offering features such as splitting all bubbles down to their minimal size, freezing the bubbles for a few seconds, and various different weapons. Monsters also enter the screen periodically, which hit the bubbles and take them down a size, and can often be directed by the cable weapon.In addition to the main Tour mode, the game also features Panic mode, in which a succession of bubbles are thrown at at the players. As the player progresses, the amount of bubbles required to reach the next level also increases, similar to scoring on Tetris.

The young man wakes up and checks his computer. Suddenly, a message arrives: the world is headed towards destruction. Only he who can summon demons through a virtual space will be able to prevent a disaster. Unable to understand what that means, the young man goes outside and finds out a murder has occurred in the nearby park. The district must be cut off from the rest of the city until the murderer is found. As the young man acquires a device that allows him to communicate with demons, he begins to realize that his role in the upcoming events may be greater than he thought.A follow-up to the first two Megami Tensei games, Shin Megami Tensei is a first-person RPG set in modern-day and post-apocalyptic Tokyo. The hero of the game can summon demons, who consume a mysterious energy called Magnetite, which can be obtained from battles. The summoned demon joins the party and is then fully controllable by the player. The active party can include up to six characters: the hero, the heroine, and four slots usually reserved for the demons, though other human characters might also join. There is a wide variety of demons in the game, most of which are taken from real-world mythologies. The demons have levels, individual statistics, spells, special abilities, etc.Enemy encounters are random, and the first-person combat is turn-based. During combat, human characters can use swords or guns; the heroine is also able to learn and cast magic spells. Unlike most other Japanese RPGs, the game allows the player to raise the parameters of the two main characters manually when leveling up. A major gameplay element are demon conversations, which is usually the only way to recruit demons. Typically, the player has to convince the demon to join the party by choosing appropriate dialogue lines. All the creatures in the world of Shin Megami Tensei belong to one of the three ideologies: Law, Chaos, or Neutral. The narrative is largely dedicated to conflicts between these ideologies; during several key moments in the story, the player has to decide which one to follow. Joining one of the ideologies influences the subsequent narrative as well as some gameplay elements: certain weapons can be only equipped by a follower of a specific ideology, demons are more likely to join the hero if he shares their ideology, etc.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Captain Novolin</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1992-11-01</td><td>raya systems</td><td>Sculptured Software, Inc.</td><td>Action, Educational</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Some Superheroes possess incredible strength, others can fly or make themselves invisible; Captain Novolin has the power of ... diabetes!

Suddenly, something goes wrong, lightning strikes, and in a moment Lester finds himself in a strange alien world. Now he must fight for his life, first with his bare hands, then with a gun he finds. But what gives him courage is that he is not alone. One of the aliens who escapes from the prison together with him helps him on his dangerous quest. Friendship can overcome all obstacles.Out of This World combines shooting, platforming, and puzzle-solving elements. The game is divided into stages; some of them are straightforward and can only be accessed one time, while others are connected to each other, constituting a larger environment. Exploration and problem-solving are emphasized. Many levels include challenges not seen in the previous ones. Tasks may involve environmental puzzles, timed sequences, precise jumping, and combat.Typically, enemies are defeated by using an energy gun found in an early stage. The gun's regular function is shooting energy projectiles. By pressing down and holding the fire button the player can activate an energy shield that protects Lester from regular attacks, allowing him to fire from relative safety until it evaporates. Finally, by holding the fire button even longer the gun creates powerful blasts which can disrupt shields. Most enemies are equipped with similar guns and are able to perform the same actions as Lester. Fighting enemies, therefore, requires tactical usage of regular attacks, shields, and bombs, as well as learning enemy patterns.Each level can be accessed by typing a code the player learns after having completed the level. If Lester dies, the level must be restarted. There is no on-screen interface and no in-game dialogue in the game. Vector graphics are used for creating the game's environments and animated cutscenes. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Prince of Persia</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1992-11-01</td><td>Konami of America, Inc.</td><td></td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td>Regional differences</td><td></td><td>Platform, Puzzle elements</td><td>Middle East</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">While the Sultan of Persia is fighting a war in a foreign country, his Grand Vizier Jaffar orchestrates a coup d'√©tat.

The gameplay is not completely linear, which means that certain choices of paths and stages will affect the player's success.The game is composed of a series of stages, in which the sea organism slowly evolves into an amphibian, and later a land-only creature. The physical changes are fairly scientifically accurate which gives the game a semi-educational purpose as well.E.V.O.: Search for Eden is based on the Japan-only computer game  46 Okunen Monogatari: The Shinkaron.

The stages, while retaining similar themes, have a completely different layout. Side-scrolling view prevails over the original's top-down perspective. There are also boss battles that were absent in the original version.Character building ("evolution") is also different. Instead of distributing evolution points into four parameters, the player now basically "buys" upgrades, which have a fixed "price". The player is able to acquire such upgrades for the creature's body parts (jaws, neck, body, etc.), raising their parameters and becoming stronger.Story elements, friendly characters (NPCs), and quest-based structure that characterized the original game have been reduced and/or omitted in this release.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Family Dog</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1993</td><td>Malibu Games</td><td>Absolute Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Arcade</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Based on a short-lived animated prime-time television series created by Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton, you play as the title dog through three levels.

Conrad finds himself in the jungle, and from that moment on his quest for survival and his lost identity begins.Flashback: The Quest for Identity incorporates elements of platforming, shooting, and problem-solving. The game can be described as a "cinematic platformer" (commonly referred to as  Prince of Persia-style), following a design philosophy that was also manifested in Delphine Software's previous work,  Another World. Compared to that game, Flashback focuses more on platforming and exploration of large levels.While a large bulk of the gameplay is dedicated to running, jumping, and shooting enemies, there is also a considerable exploration element in the game, as well as some puzzle-solving. The player navigates Conrad through platform structures, performing various moves. It is possible to simply jump or do a longer run-and-jump, run, climb, hang off ledges, and pick up objects lying on the ground. To defend himself, Conrad can shoot enemies with his gun and also use various objects (such as stones) to harm or distract them. Crouching and rolling are possible (and often essential) moves that can be executed during combat. The gun has unlimited ammunition; however, shields that Conrad uses to protect himself from attacks are depleted when he is hit and can be recharged at special stations. Though most environments in the game are hostile, there are a few locations that are devoid of enemies. The player is usually required to talk to characters, gather information, and complete tasks in an adventure-like fashion in these areas. Most of the versions utilize cutscenes with polygonal vector graphics. The CD versions replace those with pre-rendered 3D animations.

Fights are best-of-three, with points awarded for each hit, and for overall victory.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Hit the Ice: The Video Hockey League</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1993</td><td>Taito America Corporation</td><td>Taito Corporation</td><td>Action, Sports</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Hit the Ice is a fast-paced, high-impact hockey game. Having more in common with Midway's Arch Rivals than any sane hockey simulation, this arena is no place for penalties, and no place for wimps. While the idea is still to somehow put the puck into the opposing team's goal, each team only has three players, there is a heavy focus on checking, and it is possible to do a "super shot" which is strong enough to send the goalie into the net along with the puck.Available are exhibition and tournament modes for one or two players. Two players can even team up to take on the computer. The TurboGrafx-16 release also adds a four-player mode, while the Gameboy version adds a "shot race" mode where the player must get a certain number of goals as quickly as possible.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Inspector Gadget</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1993</td><td>Hudson Soft USA, Inc.</td><td>AIM</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Inspector Gadget is on yet another mission against the evil Doctor Claw and his army of M.A.D.

Before each race you will be told of the quality of the locals and the likelihood of police presence.When police are in the area, speeding beyond 110 km/h could see you branded as an offender, at which point the police will try to ram you off the road, Chase H.Q.-style. You can attempt to reach the end of the race despite this damage (which eventually hampers your speed) or simply pull over and accept a fine and the loss of race points. If the police subsequently stop you, the fine is heavier.Each race costs money to enter and your earnings can be boosted by betting on the results with the other championship drivers. If one of you wins, each driver gives you either the amount they bet or the amount you bet, whichever is lower. If a local wins you get your stake back.Lots of power-ups can be bought along the way, including tires, radar jammers, engine improvements and nitro boosts.

The first two are inspired by the beginning sequence of the movie (the finale of "Jack Slater III"), the third by the hotel funeral inside the movie world, and the last by the premiere of "Jack Slater IV" in the real world. Slater must move to the level exit before the timer or his energy runs out. Various goons stand in his way and must be defeated through kicks or punches. There are four varieties of enemies in the game, wielding either knives, baseball bats, Molotov cocktails or guns. Spent life energy can be refilled by collecting movie tickets that sometimes fall from the sky. The Genesis version adds an additional twist in the first level: a crosshair will follow Slater around and randomly shoot bullets at him. All except the first stage end with a boss fight. Bosses include The Ripper, a helicopter and main villain Benedict.The driving sequences are also seen from the side. Slater's car must avoid hitting cars and trucks parked on the road while trying to destroy enemy cars by jumping over a ramp and then landing on top of them.Cutscenes tell the story of the film between levels, following the original plot only loosely.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Legend</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1993</td><td>Seika Corporation</td><td>Arcade Zone Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Beat 'em up / brawler</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Legend is a side-scrolling beat' em up set in a fantasy world.

The goal of each level is to open the exit by pushing a magic stone on a designated spot. May can also push objects one tile ahead without moving herself. This is often used to get the stone over water that she can't cross herself. May's other ability is to create magic bubbles. She can create bubbles in three different sizes. Bubbles will pop after a certain amount of time, depending on their size. If they pop while next to the stone or another bubble, the stone or bubble will be moved one space. Since May can create several bubbles simultaneously, it is possible, and often necessary, to create chain reactions to maneuver the stone into the desired position.As the game progresses, levels become increasingly difficult and new hazards and enemies are introduced. Enemies follow a set movement pattern and can sometimes be stopped, but not destroyed by magic bubbles. Later levels are made more complicated by different types of tiles including: grass that slows down May, ice that May and the magic stone will slip over, spikes that destroy the stone if it is pushed into them, collapsing tiles that can only be walked over once, rune tiles on which May cannot create magic bubbles, teleporters and others.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Magic Boy</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1993</td><td>JVC Musical Industries, Inc.</td><td>Blue Turtle</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Platform, Puzzle elements</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Join Magic Boy as he attempts to become a master wizard, and he does this by shooting enemies, putting them in a bag, and throwing them away.

The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which can be completed in any order, while the final 'Mother of All Battles' has its own surprises. Land is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles.
 
Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.Later on higher levels, you'll also build mines and factories, as you'll need to dig a certain material for higher level weapons, depending on whether the area you're on is rich with a certain material or not. With each next level, you'll start from a higher technology level and be able to progress to one higher level up than at the previous level.If there is more than just one enemy, you can make an alliance until you crush the other one - three of you can form an alliance against fourth enemy. For what its worth, a certain numeric level of defence is always stronger from the same level of attacker, and men that are not armed (conscripts) can only kill enemy soldiers, not destroy or attack enemy fort.The main thing as always in strategy games is to be the sole survivor and lead your men to victory, experimenting on vicious technologies, equipping your men, making perfect soldiers out of them, produce shields, weapons, planes... to dominate the world and crush your opponents. You can do the battling only in a certain quadrant, but don't be long as your men will automatically start building the fort, and it will be at the bottom of age level and you'll need to invent everything for that one again.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Might and Magic II: Gates to Another World</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1993</td><td>Elite Systems Ltd.</td><td>New World Computing, Inc.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td>Direct control, Multiple units/characters control</td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The space traveler and rogue guardian Sheltem has left the world VARN, where he was pursued by the relentless Corak the Mysterious and a party of local adventurers helping him.

There, a great turmoil is caused by Sheltem's actions, and the heroes must stop his madness, preventing him from casting the planet into its own sun. Gates to Another World is the second installment in the Might and Magic series, and a sequel to Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Core gameplay is similar to predecessor, with the player creating a party of six characters and exploring vast first-person 3D environments, while fighting enemies in turn-based combat and leveling up. Unlike the first game, enemy encounters occur at set points rather than spawning randomly, though enemy type selection is still random.Like in the previous game, character classes rely each on a particular attribute to be effective. Knight, Paladin, Archer, Cleric, Sorcerer and Robber return, with the addition of two new classes, Ninja and Barbarian. Race selection features humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and half-orcs. There are several locations and items that are restricted to certain genders, alignments, or races. A new feature is the possibility to hire two non-player characters to travel with the party and participate in battles. A new skill system is introduced as well, allowing characters to learn such abilities as mountaineering (necessary to traverse mountains), linguist (for reading certain messages), cartographer (for creating an auto-map), and others.Compared to the first game, the sequel is more quest-oriented, with various characters in towns giving quests to the party, as opposed to purely exploration-based traveling in the predecessor. Time also plays a large role in this game, with some instances requiring the party to travel to different time periods. Characters also age as the game goes on; If the player waits too long, the characters' statistics will change to reflect their aging, and they will eventually die. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Morph</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1993</td><td>Sony Electronic Publishing Ltd.</td><td>Millennium Interactive Ltd.</td><td>Action, Puzzle</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td>Point and select</td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Young Morris Rolph has been trapped in limbo due to a malfunction on Dr Krankenpot's new teleport machine.

You get a set number of transformations on each level, although extra ones can be picked up at times, and there are heaters and freezers dotted around which cause transformations in some states. All this is done against a time limit.

Rex must be asking himself, "My parents put a mortgage on their house to put me through eight years of medical school just so I could scrub tar off someone's lungs like a window-washer?"  But it gets worse: Big Tobacco, pre-emptively attempting to silence the turnabout whistleblowing revelation they anticipate in the unlikely event of this salesman's recovery, have some shrinking technology of their own, and have introduced sinister nanobots into his body to ensure his -- and Rex's -- untimely demises.Washing off goo and attempting to survive the robot sprites' poor collision-detection routines comprise the large part of this game (albeit in exotic, well-rendered environments such as The Mouth, The Heart, The Lungs, and eventually The Brain -- where you struggle to clean up regenerating blobs of nicotine addiction); sporadically you also encounter mines which grill you on smoking-related health facts and myths, rewarding correct answers and blowing up when presented with falsehoods.  Though the majority of the game plays like a 2D platform shooter, there are also over-the-shoulder 1st-person inter-level sequences where you pilot a futuristic vessel through bronchial tubes and blood vessels like something out of Space Harrier or Tempest -- only with more globs of diseased sputum zooming straight toward you.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">RoboCop Versus the Terminator</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1993</td><td>Virgin Games, Inc.</td><td>Interplay Productions, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person, Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Platform, Shooter</td><td>Cyberpunk / dark sci-fi, Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In the future, human soldiers of John Connor's resistance force against the machines are fighting a losing war against Skynet and its robot forces.

Your car also comes equipped with three turbos, which can be useful if you are way behind the vehicle.But this time, cars aren't just the only things that you have to worry about. You will also encounter bikes that shoot or throw firebombs at you, as well as cars that go the wrong way. (If you crash into one of these, you'll be sent flying through the air.) Not to mention other obstacles such as barricades.Furthermore, as well as the criminal's damage indicator, you also have your own. When you finally catch up with each criminal,  they are likely to shoot at you if you get too close to their vehicle, but you may encounter criminals who have different ways of attacking you. The fourth criminal, for example, launches a missile at you if you are further behind him. Once you are shot at and hit, your indicator decreases for every time you are hit, but this rule does not apply when you're hit by passing cars.

Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.Terminator 2: Judgment Day, renamed T2: The Arcade Game for home conversions, features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film.

After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer.

With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters. The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">The Wizard of Oz</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1993</td><td>SETA U.S.A., Inc.</td><td>Manley & Associates, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Arcade, Platform, Puzzle elements</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The Wizard of Oz is a re-telling of L.

The action is split into four worlds. In each of the first three worlds, the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion can be found and controlled by the player.

While he‚Äôd like to leave the company in the hands of his son Leslie, he feels that Leslie has yet to learn to take life seriously and isn‚Äôt ready to run the company.In a desperate gamble, he leaves his brother, the strait-laced and humorless Lt. General Leland Zevo, in charge of the company. He knows that his brother is ill suited to run the company, but also knows that his military methods and lack of any sense of humor and whimsy will spur Leslie to grow up if he wants to keep Zevo Toys the way it always was.Alas, Kenneth‚Äôs plan is working TOO well: Leland is producing deadly weapons designed as toys. Tanks, helicopters, dolls, and balloons, among other things, have been designed with sinister and deadly intent. It‚Äôs a disgrace to everything that Zevo Toys stands for, and if Leslie wants to save the factory and the good name of his family, he‚Äôll have to face his uncle head on and fight toy with toy.Toys is an isometric action game based on the 1992 surreal comedy/fantasy movie of the same name starring Robin Williams, Joan Cusack and LL Cool J. As Leslie, you‚Äôll explore three areas of Zevo Toys (the West Bay factory area, the cafeteria, and the warehouse) in order to take down General Zevo‚Äôs elephant-head security cameras. To do so, you‚Äôll have to take out the active defenders of each camera such as jeeps, Hurly-Burly Helicopters, Tommy Tanks, deadly pogo stick bears, bomb-toting balloons, and much more. When the defenders in one area are cleared, you‚Äôll have to disable the camera. This is accomplished by blinding the camera‚Äôs eyes with water from your trusty water gun, then spraying the lens until the camera is destroyed. Careful, the movement of the camera will make things difficult, along with the laser mounted in the camera if you take too long...The non-camera areas aren‚Äôt safe either, with wind-up walking bombs, amorphous slime globs, spiders and toy paratroopers backing up the defenders. Fortunately, your cousin Patrick will supply you with your own toys to combat the General‚Äôs army. These range from your trusty peanut gun to bowling balls and tops to custard pies and water balloons and so much more.Once you‚Äôve destroyed all the cameras, you‚Äôll traverse a model of Manhattan via a giant toy plane. Avoid the the Hurly-Burly Helicopters and keep the plane charged using the giant charging coils, and you‚Äôll reach the General‚Äôs office and shut down his plans.It‚Äôs time to fight fire with marshmallows and let joy and innocence prevail!

His friends Iolo, Shamino and Dupre appear just in time to save him. In the Britannia castle, the Avatar learns that his abductors were gargoyles, a race of enigmatic creatures who have recently invaded Britannia and occupied the shrines of Virtue. As the Avatar embarks on a quest to liberate Britannia, he begins to gain insight into the gargoyles' true motives, and realizes that it is his duty to achieve peace and understanding between the two races.Ultima VI is notable for having a fully continuous world. There is no "world map" in the game; all the locations are seamlessly connected to each other, turning the game world into an open environment. Compared to the previous installments in the series, the game focuses more on quests and exploration rather than on combat. The latter no longer involves separate screens; battles occur during exploration, without any transitions. The turn-based system from the previous games has been preserved. The interface has been re-designed, the original key-bound commands co-existing with selectable command icons and mouse-based interaction. The game world is more detailed than in the previous games, with a large number of various objects that can be manipulated or added to the inventory. Conversations are more extended, with a wider selection of topics, including many personal ones unique to specific characters. The player is also able to conduct extensive conversations with the Avatar's companions, as well as split the party and control the characters separately. Some important topics may be highlighted during text display, to facilitate further dialogue, which requires the player to type the desired conversation topics.Like in the predecessors, the player is free to explore the game world from the beginning of the game, and visit locations in any order. Following the main quest and obtaining specific items and information is necessary to complete the story; however, the player can also opt to bypass a large part of it by using previous knowledge of the game or outside help. The FM Towns version has full voice acting for all the conversations, in English and in Japanese.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">WWF Royal Rumble</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1993</td><td>LJN, Ltd.</td><td>Sculptured Software, Inc.</td><td>Sports</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Control one of twelve World Wrestling Federation stars in a "no holds barred brawl" -- in other words, do whatever moves you want, from choke holds, piledrivers, and even chair slams, until your opponent is knocked out.

There are also several new ships: a Confederation corvette, Kilrathi and Confederation freighters and of course the Kilrathi dreadnought with the secret weapon itself.Characters from the main game can be transferred into the add-on, which also includes a "Mission Selector" to fly any of the missions from the original game.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">World Class Rugby</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1993</td><td>Imagineer Co., Ltd.</td><td>Denton Designs</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other), Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Like Domark's Rugby: The World Cup, World Class Rugby was released alongside the 1991 Rugby World Cup, which was won by New Zealand in a final against England.

Ragen, a soldier in the House Davion army, was working to infiltrate and destroy a renegade mercenary cartel called the Dark Wing Lance. However, he was discovered, and the Dark Wing took their revenge: somehow, they had learned the location of the Ragen family's residence. Under cover of night they attacked, killing everyone. Only young Herras, who was at a friend's house at the time of the massacre, survived. Unbeknownst to him, the Dark Wing made an agreement that after the strike, they would separate for ten years and maintain an absolute code of secrecy before regrouping again to continue their nefarious operations.Now, in 3027, that time is up. Herras, who has become a young man, has waited the last decade for his chance to take revenge. As a mercenary MechWarrior operating from the planet Galatea, with a light 'Mech in the hangar and 50.000 C-Bills in the bank, he will accept any mission that will lead him closer to finding the murderers of his family.MechWarrior on the SNES, while broadly similar to the PC game of the same name, puts the player into the BattleTech universe with a new story, and gameplay and controls suited to the console. The central hub in the game is Galatea. Here, Herras can visit Club Zero-Zero (for the latest news, rumors and gossip), General HeadQuarters (for mission assignments) and the 'Mech Complex (for buying, selling, repairing and customizing 'Mechs). In the club, bartender Cearle usually has some helpful advice, and other characters may also offer tips and give pointers to certain assignments that will lead Herras further in his quest. He can also view Holovids left to him by other characters as well as check out bulletins from NewsNet.At GHQ, several missions will be available at any point in the game, not all of which advance the storyline: many are entirely optional. Before accepting an assignment, the mission parameters can be studied: they include the mission type, the size of expected resistance as well as environmental conditions, like planet climate and gravity. The possible mission types are Garrison and Riot Duty (destroy all enemy 'Mechs), Recon and Objective Raids (locate and collect a specific item carried by an enemy 'Mech), Planetary Assault and Offensive Campaign (stop the enemy from entering a friendly base), Security Duty (protect a base from being overrun - from inside the site) and Siege Campaign (locate and destroy an enemy base). Before each mission, the reward for successful completion can be negotiated - often something higher than the basic offer can be reached, but asking for too much might also offend House Davion.During an actual mission, gameplay is seen from a first-person cockpit perspective, with the SNES' Mode 7 employed for a pseudo-3d effect. Specific parts of enemy 'Mechs (torso, arms and legs) can be targeted, with expected effects: losing arms also loses weapons, while damaged legs hinder movement.Earned C-Bills can be spent in the 'Mech Complex for repairs or new acquisitions. Eight different BattleMechs are available to buy and sell: four light, two medium, one heavy and one assault 'Mech, all entirely new designs not seen in the BattleTech tabletop games. The machines can be equipped with loads of different weapons: guided and unguided missiles, machine guns, lasers, and the mighty particle cannon. Missiles and energy guns build up heat with every shot: to prevent overheating, heat sinks should be installed - the problem is less pronounced on colder planets, naturally. Also available are more than a dozen different engines, as well as armor plates and jump jets (which have a much stronger effect on low-gravity planets).There are various paths through the game, depending on choices taken by the player on which assignments to handle. All in all, more than 50 storyline missions plus many optional ones await.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Shadowrun</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1993-05-01</td><td>Data East USA, Inc.</td><td>Beam Software Pty., Ltd.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td>Detective / mystery</td><td>Action RPG</td><td>Cyberpunk / dark sci-fi, Fantasy, Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td>Isometric</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">After the Awakening, magic has been re-discovered, and human beings have accepted the existence of those they thought to be fantasy creatures. Mega-corporations and cyberworlds had to give space to elves and Native American shamans. Jake Armitage was a seemingly ordinary data courier, assassinated by a hit squad in the year 2050 in Seattle, Washington. Miraculously, his true story began after his death. A mysterious figure approached Jake and cast a spell on him; after that, he woke up in the morgue. Jake doesn't know what happened to him, he doesn't even remember his own name. He is contacted by a shamanistic Dog totem with a cryptic message about his mission. Wandering through the large city where monorails, computers, and street gangs armed with automatic weapons co-exist with orcs, dwarves, and vampires, he begins to unravel the mystery, gradually learning about dangers awaiting him around every corner, and his own past.Shadowrun is based on the pen-and-paper role-playing game of the same name, more specifically on the novel Never Deal with a Dragon by Robert Charrette. It is entirely different from the Genesis adaptation of the same license. The game is a skill-based RPG with action-oriented combat. Most of the time Jake uses firearms; he can also learn magic spells, primarily with defensive and support capabilities. The player can hire "deckers", temporary party members who can aid Jake in battles, and to whom the player can assign basic commands or let them be controlled by the AI.Karma points are awarded to the player for successfully eliminating enemies. These act like experience points in other RPGs and can be manually distributed by the player. The player can increase the character's basic parameters (such as hit points or charisma), as well as have him master various skills. These include firearms, computers, negotiation, leadership, and others. Jake can also use his cyberdeck to access cyberspace known as the Matrix, for plot-related purposes or in order to obtain money. Represented by an icon, Jake moves through the cyberspace, fighting programs that protect data from intruders. Jake's success in these endeavours largely depends on his computer skill.Dialogue with non-playable characters plays an important role. Most quests involve Jake exploring various locations in Seattle and gathering information from people. Conversations are topic-based; often it is necessary to learn about a particular topic from a specific character and then choose it in a conversation with another one to obtain the necessary information.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Super Slap Shot</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1993-05-01</td><td>Virgin Interactive Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Ringler Studios</td><td>Sports</td><td>Diagonal-down, Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">A generic 5-on-5 hockey game endorsed by 'Mr. Hockey' Gordie Howe.

To get rid of the numerous enemies, Turrican can use three upgradeable shots: A spreadshot, a powerful laser and a rebound that bounces off of walls. Additionally, there is a Freeze-Beam that can be used to temporarily freeze enemies. It is fully rotatable, and therefor also a great help in discovering secret capsules. These capsules contain powerups and can often be used to reach secret areas. Last but not least, Turrican has the ability to transform into an energy wheel (as long as he has enough special energy), which enables him to lay mines and even makes him invincible.

The gameplay is reminiscent of the 3D dungeon crawl type of role-playing games popularized by Wizardry and The Bard's Tale.  However, unlike these games, Dungeon Master features real-time combat, which requires the player to click on the opponent in order to execute an attack. Another notable aspect of the game is its growth system: instead of gathering experience points and leveling up, characters improve by repeatedly using the same action. Spellcasting involves selecting and combining symbols, which can be arranged as rune sequences. The game also allows the player to directly interact with objects in the game world through a point-and-click interface.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Super Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1993-06-01</td><td>JVC Musical Industries, Inc.</td><td>Sculptured Software, Inc., LucasArts Entertainment Company LLC</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person, Behind view, Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td>Space flight</td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The sequel to  Super Star Wars is, as the name implies, based on Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, the second of the original  Star Wars movie trilogy. The game features familiar locations and events from the film, such as the ice planet Hoth, the search for Yoda on the jungle planet Dagobah, and the fight against Darth Vader. Several locations are expanded, adding places and boss enemies that did not exist in the movie, and certain key events in the story are omitted or changed. As in the previous game, the player is able to control three characters: Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca. Unlike the first, each character has been given a distinct special move. Chewie spins a path of destruction through enemies, Han has grenades and a powerful slide, and Luke can switch to his lightsaber and block oncoming fire. Gameplay is very similar to the first game, mostly focusing on platforming elements. As before, there are Mode-7 vehicle levels, during which the player is able to pilot a snowspeeder against encroaching Imperial walkers, pilot the Millennium Falcon through the asteroid field, and break through Cloud City's defenses in Luke's X-Wing fighter. The game's other major addition is the inclusion of a suite of Force powers for Luke. They are learned by collecting hidden orbs on the Dagobah level, and add a second special bar that depletes with each usage of a Force power. Power-ups include health items, weapon upgrades, screen-clearing detonators, and orbs that restore Luke's Force power. Passwords have also been added, and are given upon completion of each of the game's 25 stages.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1993-06-01</td><td>THQ Inc.</td><td>Absolute Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle is the video game adaptation of the 60's cartoon series staring Bullwinkle, a moose, and Rocky, a flying squirrel.

Unfortunately, the not-so-nice Boris and Natasha have disguised themselves as security guards for the museum and managed to steal some of the priceless artifacts.Bullwinkle and Rocky must track down the stolen artifacts and return order to Frostbite Falls.  Most of the action is of the side-scrolling platformer variety, but along the way, you will get to play lots of mini-games involving characters from the show. During the platforming sections you can switch instantly between the two protagonists.

Finding a clock adds more time to the search, clicking on a 150 icon adds 150 points to the score, etc.Each picture consists of 6 adjacent screens containing a continuous theme. The themes are The Carpet Flyers, The Underground Hunters, The Battling Monks, The Unfriendly Giants and The Land of Waldos. Players are given the option of playing on Normal difficulty, Expert difficulty, or playing the Land of Waldos stage. The only difference between the difficulties is that on expert there are no clock items to provide players with extra time.In all of the stages the player must find both Waldo and a scroll to complete the stage. Waldo must be found before the scroll in order to complete the stage. Waldo's dog Woof is also in each of these stages (except for the Land of Waldos) and by finding him players get to play a small bonus stage where they collect points as they control the dog on a flying carpet.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Wolfchild</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1993-06-01</td><td>Virgin Games, Inc.</td><td>Core Design Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Dr. Kal Morrow, expert in genetic research and creation of human-animal hybrids, has been kidnapped and his family brutally murdered by the terrorist organization CHIMERA.

Everything seemed peaceful in the country, until two warriors spotted strange creatures near the capital city. Those were... men in space suits! Of course, the warriors could not have known this and believed them to be monsters. Do the mysterious strangers have peaceful intentions, or are they a new threat to the kingdom?The second Dragon Slayer is very similar to the first game, graphically and gameplay-wise. The only major difference is the fact that the enemies are now completely visible on screen before battles, so that the player can avoid fighting them if he wants to.

Three courts are available: Grass, Clay and Indoor (Sega versions  add a fourth, Hard), but the differences between them are minimal.

There is no longer conventional professional baseball in 2020. Baseball designed by the Super Baseball Association has been very popular and is the best sport.However, the truth is that the association has used a colossal sum of money to promote Super Baseball as show business. They have manipulated each player's ability using the control computer to secretly decide victory or defeat in every game. The players who knew this removed the connecting parts of the computer to play their own game of baseball. Finally, a fair game is going to be played at Cyber Egg Stadium.In 2020 Super Baseball is a fast-paced game with new rules, where you can select 1 of 12 individual men, women, or robot players.

Loosely connected to Buddhist and local Japanese myths, it tells the story of Madara, the son of the evil Emperor Miroku. An ancient prophecy said that a young warrior with tremendous powers will dethrone Miroku, and for fear of his son's might he ordered to cut his body into eight pieces. Raised with artificial limbs, Madara soon discovered his true origin and   understood he was destined to bring down his father. The game puts you in the role of a teenager named Kamishiro, who lives in modern-day Japan. One day he and his girlfriend Subaru venture into a mysterious shrine on the outskirts of their home town, and Kamishiro met the princess Sakuya, who explained to him that he must travel to a different world and to help Madara to get rid of Miroku. During his travels Kamishiro meets many characters from the original manga story, including Madara's brother and rival, Kage-Ou, and discovers the secret connection between the two worlds.The game is a Japanese-style RPG with random battles. The combat system is turn-based, but the battles are set in auto mode, and you must pause them in order to assign commands to your characters. The battles are viewed from a dynamic third-person perspective, and the characters move around the battle field when executing their attacks.

Six months after the war against the Divine Crusaders, the heroes that defeated them (now organized in the Londo Bell special forces unit) are called back into action. The DC remnants have regained strength under the control of the Zabi family. Additionally, unexplained disappearances near lunar colonies indicate that there might be another faction in play. It is up to Londo Bell to investigate and fight the next Super Robot War.Like its predecessor, the game is a turn-based strategy game with heavy RPG elements that crosses over characters and robots from various animated TV series and puts them into an all-new story. The game features 58 missions (more than doubling the number from SRW2) and introduces a branching mission path to the series. The path through the game is determined via direct player choices during and after missions as well as mission performance (i.e. number of turns required to complete the level). The choices made also lead to three different possible endings.The basic gameplay of the series remains unchanged from the predecessor, with players having their units move and attack on a map of the area via context-sensitive menus and fights played out as animated scenes. Series mainstays like the spirit (for unleashing special powers) and negotiate (for making enemy units defect) commands also make a return.The strategic complexity however has been increased. Pilots and their robots are now separate entities with separate stats, making it possible for pilots to switch robots between missions, but only within their own franchise (i.e. Amuro Ray can control all Gundam, but no Mazinger robots). Another new feature is the ability to set one of four global counterattack strategies: from aggressive (always counterattack) to conservative (only if the counterattack can't destroy the unit or if it has more than 50% HP) to defensive (never counterattack).The pilots are rated in six stats: attack power, probability to hit, piloting skill (determining damage potential and chance of critical attacks), response (determining chance of evading attacks), willpower (required for special attacks) and intuition (a static overall bonus). Stats are automatically raised through leveling, done by gaining experience points in combat. The robots are rated in hit points, energy, range, armor and maximum response (limiting the respective pilot's stat). All stats but range can be upgraded between levels by spending money, which, like XP, is gained through defeating enemies. Additionally, both pilot and robot are also rated in their adaptability to different terrain types. Each robot comes with a variety of unique weapons, which also all have their own stats: attack power, range, probability to hit, and ammo or energy requirements. Ammo, like spirit points, only refills at the end of a mission, but energy regenerates continually.Besides adding some new robots and characters from the known franchises (including Gundam's War in the Pocket and Stardust Memory), the game introduces franchises from outside the Gundam/Mazinger/Getter Robo trinity for the first time: making their debut in the series are Raideen, Combattler V and Daitarn 3.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Super Back to the Future Part II</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1993-07-23</td><td>Toshiba-EMI Ltd.</td><td>Toshiba-EMI Ltd.</td><td>Action, Sports</td><td>Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Super Back to the Future Part II is a side-scrolling action game where the player controls an anime-like Marty through Hill Valley.

Every so often, though, he'll try to do what his mom wants him to, but more often than not, he'll misunderstand and simply confound his parents further.Arashi o Yobu Enji ("A Kindergartner Called Tempest") is one of many games based on the manga and anime created by Yoshito Usui. In four stages, each made up of five areas, Shin-chan must explore his neighborhood looking for a specific object. He can enter houses to ask people for information, but will often end up simply insulting them. He must also avoid or knock over the other children in the neighborhood, and has various ability cards that he can use to assist him, which might give him a water pistol or refill his health. After finding what he's looking for, Shin-chan will move on to the next area.Also included is a minigame mode with eight different minigames, such as a bubble-blowing contest, a three-legged race, and a desperate search for clothing before school.

In scrolling shooter levels Blade can either toss his spear to defeat enemies at range or quickly slash with it to destroy bullets and enemies. One enemy type will drop different colored System Box powerups: green restores health, red destroys all enemies onscreen (except bosses), and blue turns Blade invulnerable and able to destroy all enemies upon contact (including bosses).The end of every level is a one on one fight with an enemy Tekkaman. Each Tekkaman starts with a weapon, but the weapon will be lost if they take too much damage, forcing them to use punches and kicks. This mode can also be played in 2-player mode, where each player selects their Tekkaman.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Final Fight 2</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1993-08-01</td><td>Capcom U.S.A., Inc.</td><td>Capcom Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td>Regional differences</td><td>Martial arts</td><td>Beat 'em up / brawler</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Final Fight 2 is the SNES exclusive sequel to Final Fight which was released on the same platform.

Your task is to race through 16 countries, each of which features four races, with many real-world circuits recreated in incongruous locations (such as the Monza layout in Ayers Rock, and the old Hockenheim in Vancouver). These four-race blocks each represent their own mini-championship, in which you race against 19 cars, needing to finish in the top 10 to continue, and with the top 6 scoring points 10-6-4-3-2-1, and the respective amount of money in thousands. This can be spent on various upgrades, ranging from engine to tires (wet and dry) and from shocks (front, side and rear) to gearboxes. The ideal approach is to buy the more expensive versions ASAP, as you get no saving when upgrading. If you win the four-race championship, you get the next password. You get a set amount of nitro boost to use during each race, although bonus nitros, money and instant speed-up token appear on many tracks.

You do so by ensuring that there is enough life support, power, housing, employment, police and entertainment to keep the citizens of your colony happy. Hindering your goal are random events such as solar eclipses (which can render your solar panels inactive) and also a different, hostile alien race that inhabits the planets in the many scenarios at offer. Not only do you have to be a good mayor but you also have to be a good general. Resources must not only be attributed to civilian research but into weapons research, intelligence and the building of tanks and spaceships, if you wish to survive long enough to see your colony flourish into a metropolis.

The main options remain basically the same couple since the establishment of the series - period length (5, 10 or 20 minutes), line changes (off, manual or the new automatic mode) and penalties (off, on, on but no offsides). While there are some minor differences between platforms (Genesis  features record keeping for users and the MegaCD version has more stat screens, CD quality audio backdrops and the usual highlight clips here and there), only the PC version released at the same time features complete season action.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Pac-Attack</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1993-10-01</td><td>Namco Hometek Inc.</td><td>Namco Limited</td><td>Puzzle</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Falling block puzzle</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Based on Namco's Japanese-only arcade puzzler Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack is similar to many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo.The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a "wall" on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human player. It's similar to the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the press of a button.All of the handheld versions (including the one on Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Secret of Mana</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1993-10-01</td><td>Square Soft, Inc.</td><td>Square Co., Ltd.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Regional differences</td><td></td><td>Action RPG</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Long ago, people lived in harmony with the natural world and used the power of Mana to help their nations grow.

Hot water restored them to their original appearance, but whenever they are splashed with cold water, they turn into their "cursed" forms. The story of the game begins as Ranma and Genma are having breakfast by their friends. Suddenly, several cat-like creatures burst in and kidnap Genma. Ranma finds out that the cats belonged to Akaneko (Crimson Cat) Gang, who kidnaps strong fighters for some reason. Soon Ranma discovers that Kamusaru, the leader of the Crimson Cat Gang, is looking for an ancient treasure that will allow him to turn into a Nekomaou (Cat Demon King), and take over the world.

The game is built like a traditional Japanese RPG: your party fights random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a third-person, Final Fantasy-like perspective. In battles, you can attack physically, or use various offensive and defensive techniques, which consume "ki" (an equivalent of magic points). Not only Ranma and Genma, but also the other characters in your parties can take a different shape. You carry around a bucket of cold water, and every time you use it on one of your characters, he/she is transformed into a "cursed" form. This is sometimes required to advance the story of the game (for example, Ranma can enter a certain location only as a girl).</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Ch≈ç Jik≈´ Y≈çsai Macross: Scrambled Valkyrie</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1993-10-29</td><td>Zamuse</td><td>Winky Soft Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td>Mecha / giant robot</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The legend of the Valkyrie pilots is not yet over.

A Valkyrie changes its weapon and movement speed by switching between its three forms: Fighter, Gerwalk, and Battroid. Typically the Valkyrie weapon shoots straight and quickly, the Gerwalk weapon shoots around or through obstacles, and the Battroid weapon does higher damage in exchange for reduced firing rate. Each weapon can be upgraded up to twice by picking up power up items dropped by special enemy ships, but one level of power up will be lost any time the Valkyrie is shot. If a Valkyrie's entire life bar is depleted then the full stage must be repeated, provided the player still has enough continues.In a nod to Galaga the player is able to capture some enemy craft to increase their firepower. If the player does not shoot any weapons for a few seconds a field of electricity will cover the Valkyrie. Touching some enemy ships will then cause their targeting to be shorted out and make them friendly to the player, following along and shooting or ramming onscreen enemies.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Super Chinese World 2: Uch≈´ Ichibuto Daikai</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1993-10-29</td><td>Culture Brain Inc.</td><td>Culture Brain Inc.</td><td>Action, Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Side view, Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Fighting</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Following the events of the first Super Chinese World game, the world has been saved and Rub-A-Doc has invited the leaders of the world, including the Emperor Chin of Chinaland to a galactic peace conference.

You will only need a good target in the parquet block!Basic version differences:
The original Arcade version is a pool game where the player competes against the timer trying to get all balls in pockets and earn points.
The later NES release introduces modes for 2 players with two variants: 2P Pocket Game (the traditional mode) and 2P 9-Ball Game, where the premise is to sink 9 balls before the other player makes them first, training mode and single-player Pocket game. In 1P Pocket game the player needs to clear four levels with alternating ball layouts (i.e. reaching a predetermined number of points by sinking consecutive shots and sinking balls in numerical order), starting from City class and all the way to the World Class. Starting from State class, the player needs to perform a special trick after beating a level, and if they fail, the level restarts with a different ball layout. 
Game Boy version is a completely redrawn game featuring 1 or 2 players actions with two game modes: 9-ball and Pocket. The Pocket mode is generally similar to NES version.
Genesis and SNES versions feature improved graphics and sound. Pocket game mode is reworked to include more stages and trick shot layouts. Also in this mode the player travels to different cities in the U.S.A. and claims championship there. New modes are Trick game and Jukebox. Game Gear version of Side Pocket is basically a toned-down Genesis version.
Side Pocket for Wonder Swan features one and two-player play on a single device. In the single-player mode the player chooses an avatar from a menu and needs to beat the remaining opponents. The player and CPU then take turns in hitting the ball.

In story mode (which is based on characters from Compile's RPG series Mad≈ç Monogatari), the player controls Arle Nadja (Silvana in the English translation of the arcade version), a young sorceress, whose goal is to defeat Satan. To do so, she has to win 12 battles against his minions until she can meet him in a final confrontation. The game offers an extra training mode against three lesser opponents, as well as the ability to start from level 4 of the main game.During a match, pairs of puyos fall down from the top of the screen into each player's field. They can be moved left or right, rotated in either direction and made to drop faster. The goal is to arrange puyos of the same color into patterns of at least four, with horizontal or vertical (but no diagonal) connections. Doing so removes them from the field (with any unconnected puyos falling down) while at the same time sending garbage blocks into the opponent's field. Creating patterns of more than four, several different patterns at the same time, or chain reactions creates more garbage blocks. The garbage blocks can only be removed by creating patterns adjacent to them. The player whose playing field reaches the top first loses. In single-player mode, the falling speed of the puyos increases level by level and each of the enemies plays in a unique style.The home ports also add an endless single-player mode, in which there is no opponent (and thus no garbage blocks) and one simply plays for a high score, similar to the MSX/Famicom version.Unique to the Game Gear version is an additional quest mode. Similar to the mission mode of the original MSX/Famicom version, it presents a series of pre-filled playing fields with a specific task, like making a minimum number of puyos disappear in one move, or removing all puyos of a certain color.

But the memory of the humans is short... wars begin, breaking the world's harmony, and now the world is threatened by seven demons. Emperor Leon of Avalon tries to rid the world of the demons. One day, he goes on a treasure hunt, accompanied by his son and heir, Gerard. But the emperor is slain by a horrible monster, and now Gerard, the child of royal blood, has to continue his work.In this game, you control the royal family of Avalon throughout several generations. Unlike the  first game, where you could play eight different characters from the very beginning of the game, here you play various characters continuously, generation after generation. Each time the old emperor passes away, you'll have to choose a heir for him out of four candidates. The choice of those candidates depends on chance and on your decisions to recruit party members during your reign. You'll learn various techniques during the game and then assign them to your party members (a party contains five active characters). Characters can die permanently, i.e., become unavailable for the rest of the game, in case they lose their life points; each time a character's HP reaches zero in battle, the character loses one life point.Like its predecessor, the game was released exclusively in Japan.The worldwide release on modern platforms in December 2017 saw the game completely translated in English, with updated graphics and audio, new character classes, a new dungeon and a New Game+ feature.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Alcahest</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1993-12-17</td><td>Square Co., Ltd.</td><td>HAL Laboratory, Inc.</td><td>Action, Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>R.

Just like in Dr. Mario, there is always a pair of two blocks of varying colours falling down from the top of the screen. As long as they are falling, the blocks can be rotated. The goal is to bring three or more blocks of the same colour together; then they disappear and cause a special block to appear on the opponent's side. After a block vanishes, the blocks over it fall down. The match is lost, when the space the pair of blocks appear in is filled by another block, i.e. the screen is full.The game has eight characters and the special block mentioned above is the head of the own character. It can be only removed when matched with a block of the same colour. However, when the player manages to create a chain reaction one of two special attacks may be unleashed against the opponent, e.g. reversing the controls or obscuring the vision for 10 seconds. The attacks vary from character to character. During the campaign, the player initially takes control over Hebereke and has to defeat all other characters (best of three). After a character is defeated, it can be used for the next match. The tournament mode is a sequence of knockout matches.

Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from and should watch out for CPU soldiers doing the same.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Capcom's Soccer Shootout</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1994</td><td>Capcom U.S.A., Inc.</td><td>A-Max</td><td>Simulation, Sports</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Capcom's Soccer Shootout let's up to four players take the helm of 12 different international soccer teams in a series of games that include Exhibition, Full Season and All-Star Game modes.

But there's only one problem this year. You see, while Santa was sleeping in his bed, the cold and evil snowman spooked all the elves away, and the Timekeeper has stolen Santa's plans from his house. There won't be any Christmas if Santa doesn't stop them.In Daze Before Christmas, you're Santa. According to the game's Christmas calender, you have 24 areas to explore such as factories, workshops, caves, and more. Each area is filled with nasty enemies like penguins, jack-in-the-boxes, helicopters, snowmen, and many others. Furthermore, after every five areas, Santa has to come face-to-face with not only The Evil Snowman, The Timekeeper, and Louse the Mouse,  but also Mr. Weather.Santa's health is represented by five Santa hats. When Santa is hit by any one of his enemies, one hat is lost. If Santa loses all of his hats, then he will lose a life. He will then have to restart at the beginning of the area, unless he passes a gold bell somewhere in the area. When you explore each area, Santa can collect presents that contain a mini-Santa (aka: Extra Life), a red hat, or he may release an elf. Santa should be careful when opening these presents as some of them may contain bombs or other enemies. If Santa manages to find a spinning star, he must get it as this will take him to the next area.Santa kills his enemies by throwing magic at them. In almost each area, Santa can get a cup of hot cocoa. Doing this will transform him into Anti-Santa, a type of Santa who wears nothing but white, grows Satan's horns on top of his head, is invincible, and comes equipped with a hammer in which he can use to bonk enemies with. The Anti-Santa business only lasts for 20 seconds, but this can be changed via the Options menu.Daze acts like one of those platform games where you run through the level, shoot at enemies, and proceed to the exit. However, there are some areas where the gameplay changes, and these areas involve Santa flying through the sky in England, Russia, Japan, and the USA, and dropping presents in chimneys to score points. The game also uses a password-saving system, where entering a password given will allow gamers to restart at the beginning of a specific area, in case they happen to run out of lives.

The Beast is rather slow but with a powerful claw strike and jump-stomp attack. He can also scale certain types of walls and can catch the edges of platforms. He also has a special roar that allows him to stun certain enemies. This becomes necessary in some sections in order to freeze bats so the Beast can use them as stepping stones to higher platforms.The game has a time limit in the form of the magical rose. The Beast must battle through such levels as the dungeon and the main hall battling giant spiders, rats, rogue candle monsters, live gargoyle statues, and enchanted brooms, while collecting books for points (since Belle likes books) and magic mirrors that allow the Beast to see further into the current level to anticipate what challenges await.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Disney's The Jungle Book</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1994</td><td>Virgin Interactive Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Virgin Interactive Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Like the other adaptations of the 1967 Disney animated film The Jungle Book, the SNES version is a side-scrolling platformer starring Mowgli, the young boy raised by wolves in the jungle.

Some jungle fruit like mangoes and coconuts can also be collected and used as weapons. Other power-ups include hearts (some of them hidden in fruit) that refill Mowgli's health bar, extra lives, masks that trigger invincibility and two kinds of gems: red gems count towards extra continues at the end of a level, while green gems count toward a special ending of the game.Some variety from the standard platforming comes into play in two automatically scrolling levels: once when Mowgli rides a parrot and once when he escapes from the collapsing ruins of Louie's castle.

It was later used during another competition, the Blockbuster World Video Game Championship II, where it got its name. Afterwards, the cartridges were sold exclusively to subscribers of Nintendo Power.The game itself is largely identical to the retail cartridge, but several limitations were added to make it suitable for competitions. Most notably, a timer has been added, only allowing for five minutes of gameplay, after which the game simply freezes. Only a few select levels are playable (a total of 11, of which only 8 randomly chosen levels are available per playthrough), most of which which are not presented in normal order, and many being skipped altogether. The game starts immediately at the first level, Jungle Hijinxs, and upon exiting the level, goes immediately to the next, without showing the map. Animal Tokens in the early levels are replaced with banana bunches. In Jungle Hijinxs, Donkey Kong's Tree House and the Banana Hoard cave are inaccessible.

Combining at least three matching symbols in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line does not only clear them off the screen, but also deals damage to an opponent. This means that players do not only have to keep their game area clear, but also pay attention to their characters health bar. Once a block touches the top of the screen or the health bar is diminished the game ends.There are four different icons that have different effects when combined:
Books, swords and rocks deal damage to an opponent by attacking with fireballs, dragons or swords.
Bottles heal a certain amount of health.
Purple blocks have no effect, but clog up the screen nonetheless.Chain reactions result in particularly powerful attacks or place one or more grey blocks inside the opponents area. They can be destroyed just like ordinary blocks, but they always stay in the same spot and do not fall down.More complex chain reactions give access to special attacks, up to three of which can be held and activated with the shoulder buttons. Special attacks have different effects that include clearing all purple blocks, using all potions and clearing the bottom three lines.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">ESPN Baseball Tonight</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1994</td><td>Sony Imagesoft</td><td>Park Place Productions</td><td>Sports</td><td>Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">ESPN Baseball Tonight is a baseball game with both exhibition and playoff modes.

The European Wars against Spain and France have been costly to the British Empire. In order to gain additional funds for the war effort, the Crown raise taxes from the New World colonies without representation. This act compels the New World colonies to protest and boycott against British rule. By 1775, the Crown alarmed by the protests, boycotts and politically instability in the New World sends troops to subdue any rebellious efforts by the New World colonists. This threatening approach provokes the Thirteen Colonies to revolt. Thus starts the War for Independence in the New World (American Revolutionary War).GAMEPLAY
Choosing Sides
In Liberty or Death, you partake in the American Revolutionary War, either as the "rebels" - the American Continental Army or as the "Crown" - the British Royal Army.Choosing either one of the nations will prompt you to choose the leading Commander-in-Chief:
The Continental Army: Charles Lee, Artemas Ward or George Washington.
The British Royal Army: Henry Clinton, Thomas Gage or William Howe.
Revolutionary Politics
Each turn you will have to balance your treasury for the war effort. Money is provided by each state. The more states that support your cause, the more money will flow in your coffers. Money is spent in paying wages, strengthening the fleet and recruiting new regiments.Here, if you have a sufficient fleet, you can also command your Navy officer to "control the seas" which is conducting a blockade and privateering against enemy ships. This may result in seized goods that will be added to your treasury. The American Revolutionary War in Liberty or Death included everyone except the American Indians:  Revolutionary Militia: American supporters but not yet fully supportive of Continental Army (not under your full control)  Loyalist Militia: Militia supportive to the Crown  French Army: The French will support the American cause after a formal alliance is held.  Spanish Army: The Spaniards will support the American cause after a formal alliance is held.Revolutionary Combat

It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level, although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system as a 1-player game across all the tracks.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">NBA Live 95</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1994</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Hitmen Productions</td><td>Sports</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td>Isometric</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The first of the NBA Live titles on the PC, NBA Live 95 includes all of the basketball players from the '94 - '95 season as well as the All-Star teams from the East and West.Manage over 300 players using the General Manager feature, new in this edition.

Otto is given a letter of marque by the king and ordered to terrorize the Spanish Fleet. Equipping himself simply at first, Otto strives to become a great privateer in the name of king and country.Regardless of the character chosen, Uncharted Waters: New Horizons is a top-down sailing simulation. At sea, players control the direction of their ship, where speed is affected by the number/health of the crew, the wind and the currents. Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a port, the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings, each with unique services and goods. These include: the Inn, the Item Shop, the Shipyard, the Tavern, the Castle, the Guild Hall, the Church, the Merchant and the Harbor. It's up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are through sea trade, accepting jobs from the guild, gambling and battle with other ships.During naval combat, the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game, with the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons at enemy ships, or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the player's flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet, they can challenge the opponent to a duel. If accepted, the game changes to a side-view of the two captains engaged in a fight. During this sequence, the player can only choose which fighting maneuver (strike, thrust, parry, lash) they wish to engage in.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Nintendo PowerFest '94</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1994</td><td>Nintendo of America Inc.</td><td></td><td>Compilation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In 1994, Nintendo once again held a video game competition.

These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying  Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe & assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of enemies, and are also affected by the terrain. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Nosferatu</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1994</td><td>SETA U.S.A., Inc.</td><td>SETA Corporation</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td>Horror</td><td>Arcade, Platform</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Nosferatu, a feared vampire; no one has ever seen him and survived to tell.

You set off in your little submarine and board the ship where a horde of passengers desperately need your keen oversight and "shipsmarts".In 60 levels you have to rescue as many passengers (dubbed the Dim Passengers) as possible. At the beginning the passengers fall through a tube in the level. Similar to Lemmings you have to find a way for the passengers to the exit of the level. In order to do so, you must blast hindrances such as cargo boxes and bulkheads with bombs or, when no bombs are left, reposition the boxes with a crane. There are also conveyor belts in the levels. If the belt moves in the wrong way, the passengers either can't use it or may even be transported to their dooms, being dropped off into water, fire or steam jets. You can usually choose the direction of the belts by pulling a lever.There are several types of scenarios that Kevin Codner (you) are faced with throughout the game. Of course the puzzles get progressively more difficult, involving things like patching up cracked pipes to stop a lethal jet of steam from cooking the distressed passengers. You can blast away obstacles and stack crates in creative manners. For instance, you can have them fall onto each other to form a bridge across a gap or to provide shielding from fire. This is usually done by hoisting them onto conveyor belts using a crane.Each level has a certain "save limit", meaning you have to save at least a certain amount of passengers. This again is akin a bit towards Lemmings, and lots of levels have a built-in time limit, represented by water pouring into the compartment, rising ominously. When the water rises high enough, the passengers will get carried along with it, and they can only swim for a short period of time before getting exhausted and drowning, so you'd better be on time with some assistance.At the end of each level you receive a password (again, Lemmings-style) so that you may pick up your game from the current level without having to progress through them all from the get-go.Genesis and SNES versions feature 100 levels. Also, the Genesis version shows a password only once in 5 levels starting from level 5. Although the passwords for each level actually exist, they are never given by the game.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Snow White in Happily Ever After</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1994</td><td>American Softworks Corporation</td><td>Imagitec Design Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Arcade</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Follow the further story of Snow White after the evil Queen's death.

You can play as Snow White or Shadow Man and must go through eight levels full of platform obstacles and enemies to free the kingdom from his evil sorcery.  This side-scrolling platformer is based on an animated movie by Filmation released in 1993.  You collect fruit and stars through each level and can jump on some enemies or throw apples at them (which are also used to break through blocks). Be careful as you jump on platforms as going too close to the edge can cause you to lose balance and fall.  On the screen, your health is shown by a heart.  If you get hit by an enemy, fall down a pit, or fall from too high, it will decrease by one.  If it reaches zero, you lose one of three lives.  Some special attacks can be used, if possessed, like apple bombs.  Eventually a sign "Find The Exit" will appear and you can exit to the next level.  If you make it to the end, you must fight Maliss in dragon form.  You can change the difficulty level or choose a continuous play option as well.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Sparkster</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1994</td><td>Konami (America), Inc.</td><td>Konami Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Sparkster is a 2D side-scrolling platformer starring the eponymous hero who previously appeared in Rocket Knight Adventures. It is very different from the contemporary Genesis title Sparkster, as it does not continue the story from the first game and has completely different levels, enemies and gameplay mechanics. In that way it can be considered a spin-off in the series. The introduction merely shows how an elderly man captures a girl and takes her into his airship. At that point Sparkster appears and he decides to chase them.Sparkster is an opossum (marsupial) carrying a rocket pack on his back. He can move around, duck, jump and hang from branches or rails. His regular attack is a sword slash that sends out a circular projectile. Through the L and R buttons he can dash left and right in a circle of fire. Keeping the attack button pressed powers up a rocket meter. When full, different types or actions can be performed: dashing left, right or up to cover a large distance, ricocheting off walls in a diagonal motion, or a stationary attack.The game consists of nine levels of which the last two can only be accessed on higher difficulty levels. Sparkster collects diamonds for points, defeats all types of robot enemies and collects apples to restore his heart meter near the top of the screen. Most of the game consists of regular platforming gameplay, with a few diversions where Sparkster rides a robot bird, or is shown from a top-down view flying in the air like a vertically-scrolling shooter. All levels have a level boss along with a large number of mid-level bosses. The game supports a password system.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Speedy Gonzales in Los Gatos Bandidos</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1994</td><td>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Sun Corporation</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Arcade, Platform</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In a small Mexican village, all the mice were enjoying a fiesta until Los Gatos Bandidos, a group of cats, came and kidnapped them all.

The USS Enterprise is sent to monitor their activities and find out their real motives.Gameplay is divided into three parts: commanding the Enterprise from the bridge, controlling an away team on a planetary mission and combat with other ships.From the bridge you can control all of the ships main functions. Conn: Set course to a different planet or sector. Communication:  Communicate: with other ships. Sensors: Receive information on your surroundings or planets you are orbiting. Computer: Access a database that contains lots of information on planets, races, technology, your crew etc. Engineering: If the Enterprise got damaged during combat, you can use this command to allocate resources to the different parts of the ship that need to be repaired. Briefing Room: Receive orders and information on your current mission. Tactical Station: Engage in combat. Transporter: Assemble an away team and beam it down to a planet (which is only possible if your current mission requires it).Before starting an away mission, you have to assemble a team of four crew members that differ in strength and in tactical and technical ability. Some crew members also have special abilities, Dr. Crusher can heal other crew members, Geordi and Data can see in the dark and Data can survive without air. Away missions are shown from a top-down perspective and you can control each team member individually or order different members to follow your currently selected character around. Most away missions are a mixture of simple (real time) combat and puzzle solving that usually consists getting hints from tricorder readings and finding objects that have to be used in the correct way.Ship battles are also seen from a top-down perspective and let you attack enemy ships with phasers and photon torpedoes, while keeping an eye or your shields and trying to dodge you enemy's torpedoes. If your ship too heavily damaged you can surrender and hope that your enemy spares you.While the SNES and Genesis versions are essentially the same game, there are some noticeable differences. The Genesis version plays considerably faster during ship battles and on away missions as well as on the bridge (meaning it takes much less time to repair the ship). There are many graphical differences and the map layout for away missions is slightly different from the SNES version as well.

Is there a connection between those two events?..Super Adventure Island II is a platform game. What distinguishes it from most other games of its type (including its own predecessor) are its light role-playing and puzzle-solving elements, comparable to those of Dragon's Trap. The player can navigate Master Higgins on his raft on the overhead map, docking at different islands. Most of these islands are inaccessible in the beginning, but as the player completes stages and receives the necessary items, new areas open up, including interconnected passages.The islands themselves are large platform stages. Some areas are optional and contain items that permanently increase Master Higgins' health, as well as various weapons, armor, and magic abilities. Switch-manipulating and other types of puzzles must sometimes be solved to access these areas. Regular enemies drop health- and magic-restoring items, as well as coins, while boss enemies often award the player with a key item necessary to advance. Money can be spent on resting in inns, better equipment in shops, and new abilities learned at specific locations. The player can also visit a casino and gamble for money.

The world map consists of 50 regions, each containing one level (two training levels are also available). The stages are presented in isometric view, and one to four agents are controlled. Unlike the indirect cursor control in the computer versions, on the consoles the agents are controlled directly, with potential targets being selected automatically. Unlike the multi-layered versions of the computer game, all levels consist of one layer only.Between missions, taxes from conquered territories can be spent on researching new weapons and cybernetic upgrades for the agents. These are all the same as on the computer versions, with the exception of the flame thrower, which has been replaced with the less gruesome 'chiller'. Indirect control of the agents with drugs influencing adrenaline, perception and intelligence also remains the same.

Basic gameplay concept is reminiscent of Zelda games: you must search for keys, blasting or avoiding monsters, solving physical puzzles on your way to the meeting with an end-level guardian whom you must defeat to progress.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Ken Griffey Jr Presents Major League Baseball</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1994-03-01</td><td>Nintendo of America Inc.</td><td>Software Creations Ltd.</td><td>Simulation, Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Ken Griffey Jr Presents Major League Baseball is a baseball simulation featuring Ken Griffey Jr. of the "Nintendo Owned" Seattle Mariners.

The Flintstones: The Treasure of Sierra Madrock is a side-scrolling platformer that includes several board game elements. On a world map, Fred and Barney  throw dices to determine how many fields they can move. There are different fields that hold different challenges.Most fields require you to finish a side-scrolling platforming level. Fred and Barney can jump, club their enemies and climb trees or stone pillars. Holding down the jump button lets them hover in the air for a short moment. Throughout the levels, different power-ups and items can be found: clamps are used as money, apples replenish some health, 100 stars grant an extra life to Barney or Fred and an empty Heart frame increases their life bar.On fields marked with a skull, a boss has to be defeated. Heart fields hold bonus games in which you have to collect as many items as possible within the time limit.At amusement parks, several mini-games can be played to win items or extra lives. Mini-games include: Memory; Balls O' Fun", where you can win items by throwing a ball at them; a mini-game in which you have to stop monkeys from climbing down trees and stealing your items by hitting them with coconuts and others.In Cafes you can buy food to replenish your health.In stadiums you can participate in special challenges (3D cart races for example), in order to gain new abilities such as double jumps.While stadiums, cafes and amusement parks can be revisited, all other levels only need to be finished once.Fred and Barney are not the only characters that move about the playing field. You will also run into their wives Betty and Wilma as well as other characters that are also looking for the treasure. When Fred or Barney encounter their wives, they are dragged a few fields back. Other characters give them useful items if you can beat them at a challenge (usually a race).Other notable features are a password system and a competitive 2-player mode.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">The Peace Keepers</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1994-03-01</td><td>Jaleco USA, Inc.</td><td>Jaleco Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td>Regional differences</td><td></td><td>Arcade, Beat 'em up / brawler</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">It's the year 2015 and the most powerful organization of the planet, a company named Deutschland Moldavia, is threatening to take over the world by genetically manipulatin humans into mindless slaves or powerful monsters.
The Peace Keepers is a side-scrolling fighting game similar to games in the Final Fight series. The player can choose from four characters (plus two that become available later in the game) with different strengths and weaknesses. In addition to combinations of standard attacks, jump-, run-  and throwing attacks, all characters can also block attacks, perform single heavy attacks, special attacks that consume a certain amount of energy and super attacks. Super attacks damage all enemies on-screen, but can only be used twice per continue. If a character is hit repeatedly, there is a chance that they temporarily switch into "angry-mode" during which they are invincible and more powerful. Most levels offer different paths and exits, and after every level, a different character may be selected. This means that levels may be played through in different orders and that it is not at all necessary to play through all the levels to reach one of several endings.

It stars characters original to the series that were introduced in previous games, instead of the anime TV heroes that the main line games focus on. The game is set after the third Super Robot War and sees protagonist Masaki return to his homeland of La Gias, located on the inner surface of the hollow Earth. He finds the land engulfed in a civil war, and quickly decides to join the fight to restore peace. He soon learns that people from La Gias have opened gates to the surface, summoning robot pilots to join the war against their will, thus introducing both allies and enemies from the past wars into this new conflict. Among those summoned is Ryune, who, upon learning of the situation, decides to seek other summoned friends and help them before trying to return home. Unlike the straight science fiction scenario of the earlier games, EX goes for more of a fantasy flavor, with a medieval setting and a world of faeries, spirits, demons and magically-powered robots crossing with the hi-tech robots from the surface.The game consists of three separate campaigns plus a short training scenario: one for Masaki (easy difficulty), one for Ryune (medium difficulty) and one for a mysterious third character who was believed killed in the previous game (hard difficulty). Masaki's and Ryune's campaigns can be selected from the beginning, while the third one only unlocks upon completion of the earlier ones. All in all, the game includes more than 60 scenarios. While there are some branches in the mission tree, they are not as extensive as in the previous game. It is possible to import the results of one campaign into the beginning of another, leading to slightly different events.Gameplay is only slightly changed from the direct predecessor. Players control their units via context-sensitive menu commands on a top-down view of the area, with battles being fought via animated scenes. Changes include the ability to set counterattack strategy per enemy turn instead of globally, the introduction of ranged attacks that can be fired in the same turn after moving, dead zones for ranged attacks, and area attacks. Besides leveling up pilots and upgrading robots, individual weapons can now also be upgraded. The power statistic of pilots is gone, and special robot attacks now require high enough stats in both willpower and piloting skill. Control and UI improvements include the display of to hit chance before an attack, quick switching between units, the display of active spirit powers on pilots, several shortcuts, and diagonal cursor movement.Besides the usual assortment of Gundam, Mazinger and Getter Robo mechs, the game includes robots and characters from the series Goshogun and Dunbine, as well as a host of originals native to the La Gias scenario.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Eye of the Beholder</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1994-04-01</td><td>Capcom U.S.A., Inc.</td><td>Westwood Associates</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>1st-person</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Puzzle elements</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td>Point and select</td><td>Real-time</td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Something evil is lurking below the city of Waterdeep.

Only a single Metroid larva remained. Samus took it to a galactic research station, and scientists assured her that the powers of the larva can be harnessed to help people. However, everything goes wrong when a dragon kills the scientists, takes away the larva, and destroys the research facility. Samus follows the dragon to the planet of Zebes, where she fought Mother Brain before. She must explore the dangerous planet, stay alive, and figure out a way to retrieve the larva.Super Metroid is a platform game and a follow-up to Metroid II. Like the previous games in the series, it is not divided into separate levels; the planet Zebes is an open world which Samus traverses back and forth. This world is divided into rooms separated by doors which must be shot to be opened. Shooting is also used to open up secret passages, some of which contain nifty bonuses, but finding most of them is required to proceed in the game. There are many items to find on the way, and each new item usually makes heretofore inaccessible areas available to Samus. The items include both weaponry (such as missiles, super missiles, or upgrades to Samus's standard laser gun), energy tanks that increase Samus' max health, and other gadgets (like a grappling hook that allows Samus to stick to the ceiling). There are various enemies - alien fauna - lurking around planet Zebes. The enemies all respawn after re-entering a room, though Samus' increasing capabilities mean that they become easier to defeat as the player makes progress. After killing them, the enemies typically leave behind some health or ammo. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">The King of Dragons</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1994-04-01</td><td>Capcom U.S.A., Inc.</td><td>Capcom Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Beat 'em up / brawler</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The King of Dragons is a fantasy themed side-scrolling beat'em up.

One of the main differences is the presentation: instead of the usual dank and dark dungeon with grim walls covered by rusty chains, this game has surfaces made of cake and candy. Instead of skeletons and orcs as enemies, it features furry and cute anthropomorphic animals. Once defeated, these creatures occasionally leave behind their skin, which the hero can collect and wear for a change in statistics and new abilities. They also sometimes drop candy, the game's currency. There are several shops on each level: a tailor shop to change and store skins (it is possible to carry a maximum of six skins), shops for potions and health boosts, etc.When a random enemy encounter occurs, a menu with the options of fighting or escaping appears. After choosing to fight, another menu pops up, which includes the commands Punch, Kick, Talent, Defend, and Item. After choosing either of the first two the player is presented with a grid where an icon (a fist or a foot) can be positioned over a part of the enemy body. This provides a strategic element to the game, as different enemies have different weak spots that can be exploited. The Talent option accesses the special ability that a skin may possess.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Shin Megami Tensei II</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1994-04-18</td><td>Atlus Co., Ltd.</td><td>Atlus Co., Ltd.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Cyberpunk / dark sci-fi, Post-apocalyptic</td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Fifty years have passed since the hero of Shin Megami Tensei  followed the neutral path, defeated the leaders of Law and Chaos, and founded a state where followers of both ideologies could live freely.

A new battle for a better future begins.Shin Megami Tensei II retains all the gameplay features of the previous game. The player is able to summon demons, fuse them to create more powerful ones, make them participate in battles, talk to random enemies and receive information from them, etc. The combat is turn-based, and the player explores the complex, maze-like dungeons from a first-person perspective view. Like in the first game, the Law, Chaos, and Neutral alignments play an important role: during the course of the game, the player will have to make choices that influence the alignment of the protagonist, steering the storyline into different directions.New features include a "magic succession" system, which allows demons to carry over their original magic spells when they are fused into new ones, a few additional spells and abilities, and the possibility to play at the casino and win unique items.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">F-1 Grand Prix Part III</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1994-04-22</td><td>Video System Co., Ltd.</td><td>Video System Co., Ltd.</td><td>Racing / Driving</td><td>Top-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Arcade</td><td></td><td>Automobile, Track racing</td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">F-1 Grand Prix Part III is the third title in Video System's licensed F-1 Grand Prix series.Based on the 1993 Formula One season, the main gameplay is the same as its predecessor.

Two buttons are used to control the ball, one for normal actions and one for Hyper Plays, special attacks that can only be learned and used in the Hyper League.

It's a stormy night, and the luxury ocean liner "Lady Crithania" is about to be capsized by an enormous wave.  Many of its crew and its 2300 passengers will be killed outright in the initial overturning; in the transfigured catastrophic ship environment, most of the remainder will be unable to locate, reach and secure a safe exit from the sinking ship before it floods entirely.  Inspired by Paul Gallico's 1969 novel The Poseidon Adventure, this game puts the player in the shoes of one of four denizens of the fated vessel: Capris Wisher, architect; Redwin Gardener, counselor; Luke Haines, sailor; or Jeffrey Howell, doctor.  Each of these gentlemen possess certain exclusive skills and distinct backstories and motivations - a successful strategy toward winning the game will vary greatly depending on which character the player initially selects to control.The goal is not to be on the ship when it goes down for the last time.  Accomplishing this demands mastery of a new skill hitherto untapped by its platform-game spiritual predecessors Prince of Persia and Flashback: exploring and navigating the ship in both an upright and an upside-down position, as well as many of the gradiated permutations between - thanks to dizzying Mode 7 abuse, the game environment will tip, tilt and skew at predictable intervals, granting access to some previously unreachable areas while denying access to other portions of the ship the player perhaps intended to go back through.A successful evacuation is going to require the assistance of other survivors.  Supposing the player can find and reach them, it will still be necessary to safely lead them past obstacles and hazards; as with most NPCs, they're slower and less agile than the protagonist, necessitating plotting out the simplest, safest course possible, given the circumstances. The game's ending is determined by which and how many people the player managed to rescue.The game must be completed within a time limit of one hour. Since injury in this dangerous and unpredictable environment is so frequent and, indeed, inevitable, death has been replaced by a deduction of five minutes from the time remaining; but no matter how safe the protagonist may find himself after one hour of game time, when the countdown reaches zero, it's game over.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Saturday Night Slam Masters</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1994-06-01</td><td>Capcom U.S.A., Inc.</td><td>Capcom Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action, Sports</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Fighting</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Saturday Night Slam Masters is a wrestling game.

However during their time away, the Earth Federation has been taken over by the ambitious General Forrest, who seeks to wage war on the independent systems and conquer them. Recognizing the potential weapons that could be made from the Berzerker science data, Forrest impounds the Swordfish and jails it's crew. The Berzerker data is used to create "Overtech" and bring to life "Metalliforms", self-replicating war machines. The Swordfish crew manages to escape, thanks to a mysterious agent "CJ", and are recruited into the resistance against the Earth Federation. Given a new spaceship, the Galvodirge, they must travel the galaxy to different human civilizations and devise a plan to stop Earth's attack.Cyber Knight II is an RPG with science-fiction themes. As in the first game, much of the game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Galvodirge starship. The Galvodirge can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, the crew can debark either on foot or using combat modules (mechs). Some areas are only accessible using modules and others (such as towns) do not allow the use of these war machines. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated enemies leave behind "NeoParts", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. The crew are divided into a three person "combat team" and a three person "support team". If modules are used, they can be assigned from the ship's hanger. Unlike the first game, modules only perform a combat or a support role, and each is unique in statistics and the type of weaponry it can carry. When combat occurs on the main map, the support team will often deliver the first strike by firing missiles into the enemies. When searching facilities, caves or other locations, the support team is not available. Following either case, the combat team engages the enemy in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of "options" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Galvodirge.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Osu!!

Its name is the Karate Club, based on the grounds of Kangokou High School. But now the club's in danger of losing that reputation. A bunch of would-be tough guys have come to Osaka, and are out to prove themselves against the club. It's up to Yoshiyuki Takagi, the leader of the club and of the Osaka thug scene, to turn them back and prove, once and for all, that his club is truly the toughest of the tough.Based on the Japanese manga series, Osu!! Karate Bu is a fighting game similar to those being produced at the time in which a single player controlling Yoshiyuki Takagi battles through a series of tough men in order to prove his club's toughness. Each of the game's 12 characters has a life meter that must be reduced to 0, as well as a chi meter which not only allows players to execute special moves (depending on how much chi is left), but also helps players get back up after getting knocked out. (The quicker you get up, the more health you gain back.) But this can only be done twice per match, and if it happens three times you'll be down for the count.In addition to the story mode, players can also choose to play an arcade mode in which any character can prove he's the toughest, as well as a 2-player VS mode and a team battle in which players choose teams of up to five combatants to battle against each other.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Oishii Puzzle wa Irimasen ka</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1994-08-31</td><td>Sunsoft</td><td>Kuusoukagaku Corp.</td><td>Puzzle</td><td>Diagonal-down, Side view, Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Party game</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Oishii Puzzle Wa Irimasen Ka is a party game with characters from Sunsoft's Hebereke series.

These stories appear to have no common points at first; each one has its own protagonists and goals: the prehistoric chapter is dedicated to love and friendship that existed before humans invented language; the Chinese chapter is a tale of an old master who must choose a perfect apprentice; the Japanese (Bakumatsu period) episode stars a ninja that infiltrates a warlord's castle; the Old West scenario is a classic tale of rivalry and revenge; modern-day story is a simple recounting of a fighting tournament; near future chapter deals with urban life and psychic abilities; finally, the space episode is a horror story in which a robot must investigate mysterious deaths of the crew members. The player can choose to play the scenarios in any order, but must complete them all in order to unlock the eighth scenario, and eventually the final chapter - both of which explain the connections between the separate stories and deliver the grand finale.The main gameplay system in Live a Live is that of a Japanese-style role-playing game with turn-based battles. Unlike most games of its kind, the battles take place on a single-screen field, on which the player can freely navigate the characters. Positioning the characters is crucial in many battles, as enemy attacks often have area effects; weapon range also plays a role in combat. The chapters may vary drastically in gameplay. For example, the ninja chapter is mostly based on stealth; finding ways to avoid the enemies is preferable to engaging them in battles. The near future chapter features mind-reading and other puzzle-solving elements. The sci-fi chapter is unique gameplay-wise, having no battles at all, the gameplay focusing entirely on exploration and gradually solving the mystery.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Spectre</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1994-09-07</td><td>Cybersoft, Inc.</td><td>Peninsula Gameworks</td><td>Action, Racing / Driving, Strategy</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td>Tank</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Spectre is a 3D shooter where the player drives a little red car/tank and blasts away enemies.  The gameplay is similar to Battlezone, and obviously inspired by it.There is a selection of three tanks, each with three values (speed; armor; and firepower) balanced out to match its name: Tough Guy is heavy on armor, but slow and not very powerful; Speedy is fast, but low armor; and Balanced combines both strengths, but decreased. A fourth tank allows the player to design a custom variant.Every level consists of a large plane filled with enemy tanks, several psychedelic walls with odd images that often flicker or warp resembling an acid trip, and tacky 3D models like windmills.  The object of each level is to either destroy all the enemy tanks in the level, or to collect all the flags. Every level has a certain theme to it, anything from plain green to a colorful blinking eye or images of sand dunes are to be found on the walls, windmills and flags throughout the level.With every passing level, enemy tanks grow smarter and their rates of fire increases.  Also in later levels, new, smarter, more powerful enemy tanks join the skirmish. The player has a limited amount of ammo, but driving over ammo deposits replenishes a small amount of ammunition, as well as driving over shield deposits grants additional shields. The three different views (first, third, and top-down) allow the player to incorporate additional strategies into the battles.The game boasts having supposedly an infinite amount of levels, though anything after level 80 is almost instant death.  A high score table is also included.An additional note-worthy feature of this game is the multi-player mode. Up to eight players are supported over IPX, or NetBios (or two via modem or serial port). The network option offers three Cyberspace Scenarios: Arena - free-for-all battles, get one point for each opponent destroyed.Flag Rally - a match point given for collecting six flags, destroy someone to get any flags being carried.Base Raid - Akin to "capture the flag".  Two teams, two bases; get match point for destroying opponent base.The CD-ROM manual includes a "Cyberpunk story", to give background information on the game which consisted of a cyberjock named Hart who lived for the battles in the Arena.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Kid Klown in Crazy Chase</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1994-09-10</td><td>Kotobuki System Co., Ltd.</td><td></td><td>Action</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">You play as a clown, trying to finish the level while avoiding Blackjack's booby traps.To successfully finish each level, you'll need to beat the fuse.

Each stage contains mushrooms and enemies. The stage is completed when all mushrooms have been trapped in enclosed areas and cut out. If an enemy touches one of the arrows a life is lost. There are also enemies that can temporarily disrupt the enclosure by cutting the strings.

But with time, the queen's power fades, and a new queen must replace her. Several candidates compete until one of them proves that she has the knowledge of the nine elements and has convinced the Guardians to lend their power to her. The heroine of the game is a seventeen-year-old Angelique Limoges, and her main adversary is a rather unpleasant girl named Rosalia. Will Angelique be able to befriend the Guardians and become the next queen?Angelique borrows elements from different genres: Japanese-style adventure (without puzzles), "dating sim", and (not overly complex) strategy. The goal is to make sure that Angelique has good relationship with the Guardians, maintaining the balance. For that, Angelique has to visit them daily, talk to them, and see what effects their powers have over the land. The situation is further complicated by the fact that Angelique - depending on the Zodiac sign the player chooses for her - has a certain affinity with one of the elements, and therefore, with one of the Guardians. This can lead to a love relationship, which will forfeit Angelique's chances to become a queen, but deliver an ending which can still be considered satisfying. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Blackthorne</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1994-09-23</td><td>Interplay Productions, Inc.</td><td>Blizzard Entertainment Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Platform, Shooter</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The planet Tuul was a peaceful place, until the evil warrior Sarlac used the power of the Darkstone to take control.

Aside from receiving orders from your boss before each level, and the quick conversation with a boss or rare NPC, the story won't attempt to get in the way of beat-downs.There are three playable characters in the SNES version: the martial artist Makai, the mace wielding cat-girl Iyo, and the autonomous robot Belva. The Arcade version offers three additional characters: wrestler Tarukusu, beastman Zeldia and the purple haired Kurokishi and one extra stage called High way. Each has unique moves as well as the basic abilities of attacking, jumping, blocking, throwing, and using a special if attack and jump are pressed together. Unlike most brawlers these special moves deplete a recharging special bar, not your health. Makai can throw fireballs and do a flying kick in midair, Iyo can triangle jump and preform a spinning piledriver, and Belva can double jump and preform a grapple special. Characters also have a team up special if playing in two player mode. Enemies range from armored soldiers to lizard men to robots, but most break down into the same hierarchy: weaker types will rush at you while stronger types will shoot projectiles then rush at you. Each level ends with a unique boss with multiple short and long range attacks.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Dragon Ball Z: Super But≈çden 3</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1994-09-29</td><td>Bandai Co., Ltd.</td><td>Tose Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td>Martial arts</td><td>Fighting</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Dragon Ball Z: Super But≈çden 3 (known as Dragon Ball Z: Ultime Menace in France) is the last installment to the Super But≈çden series for the SNES, which in this occasion is based on the Majin Buu saga.

People remember it as one of the most horrible tragedies in history. Since the War of the Magi, magic has been all but forgotten, technology began to grow, and people returned to seemingly normal lives. The only true worry people have is the Empire, whose leaders are looking to revive the great force once known as "magic". The Empire had heard word of the remains of a mystical being, known as "Esper", being found in the mining town of Narshe. Quickly, three soldiers were dispatched to find this Esper and bring it to the Emperor. One of the soldiers, a young girl, triggers a power in the Esper that initiates a dangerous series of events. The only ones who can help her are a rag-tag band of rebels and heroes, who offer their very hearts and souls to save the world from the mad plans of the Empire.The sixth entry in the Final Fantasy series was dubbed Final Fantasy III in the West because three out of the five previous installments of the series had not been released there at the time. Similar to its predecessors, this is a role-playing game where the player controls a party of characters, traveling between various locales in the world, fighting randomly appearing regular enemies and bosses, and making the characters stronger by improving their skills and getting better equipment for them. The game maintains the ATB (active time battle) system of the two previous installments in the series, spicing traditional turn-based combat engine with a real-time element. In battle, every character can fight using weaponry and items, and each has a special combat skill as well. It is also possible for nearly every character to learn magic spells. By finding various Espers and equipping them on characters, the player can improve their parameters in different ways and choose the magic spells the characters should learn.Unlike most other Japanese RPGs, the game does not have a single main character. Rather, the player-controlled party can be considered the game's collective protagonist. The first part of the game develops linearly, with one of the characters playing a central role; however, during the second part, the player is associated with a different character initially, exploring the game world, recruiting characters, and completing sub-quests in a non-linear fashion.PlayStation re-release of the game includes new FMV cutscenes, bestiary, and artwork galleries. Game Boy Advance version and later Android, iOS, and PC releases remove FMVs but instead include two new bonus dungeons (the Dragons' Den and the Soul Shrine), new bosses, espers, weapons, and gear, as well as many other minor additions and changes.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Firestriker</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1994-10-01</td><td>DTMC, Inc.</td><td>Axes Art Amuse, Hect Co.

competed for the Trialight, a weapon created by the Arch Mage Wylde that can only be used by a Firestriker. The kingdom of wind won and united the four kingdoms. Wylde however, was not satisfied with peace and conjured four monsters to overthrow the united world. Now, only the kingdom of wind remains and the player takes control over the last Firestriker to free the other kingdoms and defeat the monsters.Even though Firestriker looks like a typical SNES RPG, it is in fact an action game that has more in common with a pinball-game than with any other genre. The Trialight is a ball of fire that basically behaves like a pinball. The player controls the Firestriker who can freely walk across the screen and strike at the Trialight to control its movement. Levels are filled with obstacles, destroyable block and monsters. Monsters and blocks can only be destroyed by the Trialight. The goal of each level is to maneuver the Trialight towards the exit of the screen. The exit is usually blocked by destroyable obstacles and sometimes certain conditions (such as killing all monsters or destroying certain objects) have to be fulfilled before a level can be completed. If the Firestriker is killed or the Trialight falls off the screen, the player loses a life. Additionally to the Firestriker, the player can use the shoulder buttons to control a magician who (in single player mode) stays at the bottom of the screen. The levels consist of several screens and are entered from a world map. As the game progresses, the player will also fight several bosses and free other Firestrikers whose special abilities are necessary to complete the game.Firestriker also features a two-player cooperative mode as well as a duel-mode for up to four players. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Hammerlock Wrestling</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1994-10-01</td><td>Jaleco USA, Inc.</td><td>Jaleco Ltd.</td><td>Sports</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Fighting</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Hammerlock Wrestling is Jaleco's take on wrestling with a style geared towards Saturday Night Slam Masters.

The player takes control of Frodo Baggins, who must find companions for his quest. The game's locations, individual objectives, missions, and quests are structured quite differently from those of the computer release. Most of the quests involve retrieving items for various NPCs, thus advancing the narrative.The gameplay is also different from the computer version, being less heavy on character development (role-playing), and more oriented towards combat, which is action-based in this release. Though up to three characters join Frodo on his quest, one player can control only one character at a time. Multiplayer has been therefore added to the game, with up to four players controlling the characters in the party simultaneously.The game cartridge does not contain any RAM/battery; games can only be saved by remembering a code.

You have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of fire.

Most levels present Batman with a large number of henchmen to take out and environmental dangers to avoid on his way to one or more boss battles, but some deviate from the norm. For instance, Catwoman's stage is a large chase over Gotham City's rooftops with no enemies besides Catwoman herself. In the Penguin's level, Batman must navigate the dark corridors of Gotham City's museum, rescuing the staff. Two-Face's level is a driving sequence, seen from a top-down perspective.Besides kicks, throws and punches, Batman can use a variety of equipment against the enemies. Always available are Batarangs and the grappling hook. Before each mission, Batman can also select additional equipment, like knockout gas spray, throwing stars, smoke bombs and plastic explosives, all with limited ammunition. Special equipment required for certain levels include a flashlight, gas mask and X-ray goggles. If some necessary equipment is missing, it is always possible to return to the Batcave to change the gear and then restart the current level.Many of the situations and environments of the levels are based on episodes from the series and the game's graphics emulate the animation and drawing style of the show.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">True Lies</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1994-12-01</td><td>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Beam Software Pty., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Take charge of gun toting Arnie in this top down omni-scrolling action shooter.

Instead of directly controlling the monsters and bombs that are falling down, the player controls Toad who has to carry around stacks of monsters and bombs and to combine them in the right way. One bomb plus at least two monsters of the same color have to be combined to make them disappear. If five or more objects are cleared at the same time, a diamond will appear. Destroying the diamond will clear all monsters of the diamond's color.There are four different ways to pick up objects. The A button lets Toad pick up the whole stack that is in front of him, the B button lets him only pick up one object, even if it's in the middle of a stack, the Y button lets him kick a monster or bomb that's in front of him and the X button places him on top of the stack that he is carrying. He can also run up walls and stacks to catch falling objects out of the air or to pick up certain parts of a stack.There are 5 different modes of play: a "Round Game" in which Toad has to clear numerous levels, a match versus a computer controlled opponent, a two player mode, a "Time Race" mode, and finally, an extensive training mode.There are some differences between the SNES and NES versions. Due to a lack of buttons, controls are a little different in the NES version (although all the moves from the SNES version are present). Also, there is no vs. mode against the computer, but the "Round Game" mode features two modes of play: one that includes boss-fights on every level ending with a 9. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Aretha II: Ariel no Fushigi na Tabi</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1994-12-02</td><td>Yanoman Corporation</td><td>Japan Art Media Co., Ltd.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>1st-person, Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Japanese-style RPG (JRPG)</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The game continues the story of the young princess Ariel.

Tetris Classic, of course, is the basic version of the game, which comes with an endless mode and a 25-line "standard" mode. Familiss, as the name might suggest, is a family mode for up to four players simultaneously. Sparkliss, meanwhile, is very similar to Bombliss from Super Tetris 2, only with a medieval fantasy theme and different explosion patterns. Sparkliss includes both a stage mode and a puzzle mode.The most unique mode is Magicaliss, which has never shown up on any other version of Tetris. In Magicaliss, pieces come in three basic colors, and by rotating the piece, the player can choose between them. Creating a line entirely out of one color will clear all blocks on the screen of that color. There are also grey pieces, which can only be cleared by creating a line made entirely from one color, which will cause all grey blocks on screen to become that color. There are also rare rainbow pieces which will act as any color. Besides these additions, the game itself is basic Tetris.Tetris Classic, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss can also be played in a two-player battle mode, besides the four-player Familiss mode.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Super Wrestle Angels</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1994-12-16</td><td>Imagineer Co., Ltd.</td><td>Communication Group Plum</td><td>Sports, Strategy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Managerial / business simulation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Super Wrestle Angels is the first console release in the long-running Wrestle Angels wrestling management series.

The first Gundam production not set in the continuity established in the 1979 original series of the franchise, G Gundam presents a world in which global conflicts are settled in a yearly tournament fought between Gundam mecha, each representing its nation's qualities (and stereotypes). Naturally, this premise was adapted into a one-on-one fighting game.The game includes 10 different Gundams (one of which can only be selected by players via a secret code), each with its own arena and background music. Four different playing modes are on offer:
Story Battle allows a limited selection of only five Gundams (the members of the Shuffle Alliance in the series), presenting a series of nine matches against all other Gundams in the game. All matches consist of only one round.
Versus Battle is for two-player matches. Players choose their Gundam, its pilot (different pilots have different attributes regarding performance, defence and speed) and arena. Both players can select the same Gundam (with the exception of the secret character) and pilot. Matches are best-of-three. Handicaps can be set for each player.
Championship Battle is similar to Story Battle, but is in best-of-three mode, allows Gundam selection from the full roster and lacks story sequences.
Team Battle is a team-based two-player mode. Players select between one to five Gundams per team. One-round matches follow, with the loser being removed from the roster until only one team remains.
Controls involve the four face buttons for weak and strong punches and kicks, and the two shoulder buttons for quick forward or backward dashes. Each Gundam has its own special moves triggered via input combinations, including extra powerful "desperation attacks", which can only be activated if the Gundam's life bar has been significantly lowered and flashes red.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Dual Orb II</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1994-12-29</td><td>I'Max Corp.</td><td>Prism Kikaku Ltd.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td>Isometric</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Long time ago, a flourishing civilization was destroyed by the rage of a mighty dragon.

The games have a slight graphical update when compared with the original Game Boy and NES games, but the gameplay remains totally faithful to the games released for both platforms.In Tetris, the main objective is to pile blocks that will fall down continuously, in order to create a row or "line" without spaces. For this collection, the game comes with two bonus options: 2 PLAYER GAME (absent in the NES version) and VS. COM (absent in both versions), with 3 CPU opponents available, each one representing a difficulty level (EASY, MEDIUM, and HARD, respectively).In Dr. Mario, the objective is to eliminate all the viruses contained in a big bottle. Dr. Mario (situated in the upper-right side of the screen) will throw capsules with 6 different color combinations (Red-Red, Red-Blue, Yellow-Yellow, Red-Yellow, Blue-Blue and Blue-Yellow) in order to line up at least four viruses or capsules of the same color horizontally or vertically and to make them disappear. In this compilation, the game comes with a bonus option: VS. COM, where you'll face the CPU players: Blue Virus (EASY), Yellow Virus (MEDIUM), and Red Virus (HARD).For competitive players in both games, there is Mixed Match, where you and a friend can play Tetris and Dr. Mario like a tournament! Adjust the handicap levels, play time, music, and other settings to balance your different skills. The game order is: TETRIS B-TYPE (clear a certain amount of lines), DR. MARIO (disinfect a predetermined number of viruses) and TETRIS A-TYPE (clear lines until the time expires). At the end of the time limit, the player with the highest score is the winner.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">A.S.P.: Air Strike Patrol</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995</td><td>SETA U.S.A., Inc.</td><td>Opus Corp.</td><td>Action</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td></td><td>Flight / aviation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Isometric</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Playing as a jet pilot of the "Coalition" force, players take control of either an F-15 Eagle, or an A-10 Tankbuster jet. The mission is to neutralise the offensive forces of the Zarak army, who have recently invaded a smaller neighbouring country. The Zarak army has many ground units, including tanks, stinger-missile launchers, SCUD missiles and armored vehicles.To accomplish the ultimate goal of defeating the Zarak army, players venture out on numerous missions (called "sorties") that have varied and specific objectives. Typically, various installations such as radar sites, air bases or ground units are the target. Other missions include disabling an oil-pipeline and destroying SCUD launchers before they fire. Pre-mission screens ask the player to select from the two planes. Then,  the player can specify the armament to carry into the sortie. Air-to-ground and air-to-air missiles are available for each of the planes. Here, a strategic choice between countering either air units or ground units has to be made, as each area (of which there are eight) is patrolled by opposing enemy F-15 jets.The game is played through the isometric-perspective, and the plane's speed and direction can be be adjusted in real-time. Altitude however, is fixed. A missile/bomb-target is constantly shown on the ground before the plane, allowing players to aim at units, or, with the F-15, a lock-on targeting system is available.The game also makes use of a briefing before each mission, and also a further briefing by an animated colonel on the tarmac just before take-off. Various debriefing screens are shown also, and, if the player attains a certain strike rate, a "GNN" news story may play out. For each mission, a time-limit and minimum destruction-rate must be met. You can take-off as often as need be to attain this.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Big Sky Trooper</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995</td><td>JVC Musical Industries, Inc.</td><td>LucasArts</td><td>Action</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Puzzle elements, Shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td>Justin R.

The Classic tribe has the ones from the original and is perhaps the best option for first-time players. The others range from digging methods such as a scooper (diagonally downwards) and club basher (horizontal), building skills such as a planter (takes time to produce the desired raise to the landscape) and a sand pourer, and various methods of movement including a Pole-Vaulter and a Skater (the only Lemmings who can cross ice). Some of these are only subtly different from others, and their exact uses are unclear, but there are 4 Trainer levels where you can select any combination of skills and experiment.Unlike the first game, the player is rewarded for saving as many Lemmings as possible, rather than simply passing or failing. The ultimate aim is to save all 60 Lemmings through all levels, thereby earning a Gold Medal for that tribe - Silver and Bronze are also on offer. The player can also go back over levels in the hope of saving more Lems. Because there are 12 tribes, and the player can switch between them at any point, you have to be stuck 12 times to be unable to progress.

The rangers must face off against Lord Zedd's Putty Patrol (whose troops come in more than a dozen varieties), several small and one large boss per stage. Six different rangers (Red, Yellow, Blue, Pink, Black and White) are available for selection before every level. In the two-player mode, two rangers can play at the same time.The rangers begin each level in their civilian outfits and must collect power-ups from defeated enemies to slowly fill a power bar. Once that bar is full, they can transform into their ranger outfit at the press of a button, making them more resilient to damage and their attacks more powerful. Filling the power bar again allows them to use a signature weapon unique to each ranger for a limited time or perform an extra powerful special attack.The game takes place on two lanes, and at most points in the game it is possible to jump between foreground and background to get to enemies or evade obstacles. In two-player mode it is of course possible to keep each ranger on their dedicated lane and only switch if absolutely necessary.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Mo Hawk &amp; Headphone Jack</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995</td><td>THQ Inc.</td><td>Black Pearl Software</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Platform</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Protean platform hero with attitude (well, with sunglasses) rocks out in this novel but forgotten would-be Sonic-killer, collecting CDs (this is pre-Napster, remember) and avoiding segmented slinkies and nasty robot bugs in disorienting mode 7 mazes with no constant "down".The boneless wonder (er, and his Walkman) pours himself into cracks, splatters against walls, curls into a defensive porcupine-koosh hybrid, always lands on his feet (by growing feet where his hands were!) and blasts apart into little jelly gibs as a special offensive attack.

We learned well from the film that the power time travel affords corrupts all men weaker than the Muscles from Brussels, and this has extended to the original inventor of time travel. He proclaims himself dictator of the universe, captures Van Damme as he arrives from fixing all the wrongs in the film, and challenges him to a "duel across time." Platforming action follows across multiple periods of history.The primary feature of this game is its digitized characters, uncommon for console games of that era. Actors were taped in front of a bluescreen and stills were taken from the video to create all characters and their animations. The effect is impressive for the SNES, though it does result in robotic enemies who do not respond well to being punched or kicked. The "timing,", both in terms of controlling your character and fighting with enemy characters seems off through the entire game.There are 15 levels in total, most of which are standard fighting platform levels. Three basic fighting moves are available to the character, not including jumping and crouching kicks, and not including the use of a gun with extremely limited ammo. Some vehicle levels are mixed in, and the game culminates in a jetpack duel over Los Angeles with the villainous time travel creator fellow.The game also featured some rare use of digital voice, primarily in the "FBI...

If the group you create is four creatures, like cats or pigs, then a row of those will be added to the top of your competitor's stack.

Aside from the usual secret characters and cheat modes, the T.E. also includes four new additions you can individually enable from the special options menu:
"Hot Spots" are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points (up to a 9-point shot!) for making a basket while standing within them.Powerup icons appear randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when picked up. Some examples are instant "on-fire," enhanced 3-point accuracy, monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that knocks all other players to the ground."Juice Mode" increases the speed of the game up to 4x."Tournament Mode" disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and challenges you to defeat all the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also unlocks a higher CPU difficulty level.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Bish≈çjo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Kurukkurin</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-02-24</td><td>Bandai Co., Ltd.</td><td>Tom Create Co., Ltd.</td><td>Puzzle, Strategy</td><td>Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Falling block puzzle, Tile matching puzzle</td><td></td><td></td><td>Point and select</td><td>Real-time</td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Kurukkurin is a competitive puzzle game featuring Sailor Moon licensed characters.Upon choosing a character (each with unique special moves), the player competes against an opponent.

At Huffman Island, located in the the pacific ocean, wanzers are deployed by both the USN (United States of the New Continent) and the OCU (Oceana Community Union), who dispute ownership over the island.  One night, the OCU forces stage a covert recon mission on a facility located in Larcus, a USN-held territory and weapons facility. Lead by a soldier named Roid, this mission was entirely unofficial and violated the peace treaty. During the mission, USN forces lead by Commander Driscoll appeared and ambushed the OCU soldiers. During the combat, Roid's fiance, Karen is killed and the USN facility is blown up; placing the blame on the OCU. This became known as the "Larcus Incident" and the OCU denied all knowledge of it's soldiers actions. Ultimately it would be a leading cause to the second Huffman War. One year later, the war is underway and Huffman island is under provisional control of the OCU, but with a weakened military unable to defend against USN attacks. The soldiers involved in the Larcus Incident have all been discharged and disgraced. Roid spends his time fighting as a gladiator in the Wanzer fighting arena before being approached by a mysterious man. Colonel Olson has found out about Roid's history and wants him to command a mercenary unit he is assembling on behalf of the OCU, dubbed "Carrion Crow". Convincing Roid that Driscoll is still out there on the island, Roid agrees.Front Mission is a turn-based strategy RPG played from an isometric perspective. Players progress in the story through large strategic battles involving multiple units and cutscenes between them. At certain places, usually towns, the player can visit multiple locations including bars and shops, and talk to people. Shops are also found to purchase new weaponry, parts and make repairs. In combat, each Wanzer robot is a separate unit that has a large variety of weapons and attack styles depending on what's equipped. Units get experience for defeating enemies and also for using various techniques. The more an attack is used, the more powerful it becomes.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Astro Go!

It greatly increases the number of levels, has new gameplay features, and introduces new modes.The general concept remains the same: the player controls a catapult at the bottom of the screen that shoots bubbles of random colors. When three or more bubbles of the same color touch on the playfield, they are removed, with any bubbles falling away that are not attached to the ceiling, sidewall, or another bubble. The ceiling periodically descends, pushing the bubbles downward. The game is lost if any bubbles touch the bottom.In single-player mode, the goal is to clear pre-set bubble patterns. The game consists of 100 levels, more than tripling the number from the arcade game. Some arcade levels are reused, but most are entirely new. Also new are gameplay elements in the form of special bubbles: explosive bubbles destroy bubbles in a small radius around them if hit. Lightning bubbles move sideways if hit, clearing a horizontal line. Water bubbles burst, with the downward stream recoloring all bubbles it touches. Another new element is a boss fight in the final level.The two-player mode from the arcade version also reappears, but optionally adds a series of ten computer opponents with different playing strategies. In two-player mode, the goal is to make the other player fail. Instead of the ceiling descending, new bubbles are added from the top. Removing more than the required three bubbles at a time sends bubbles to the opponent's field.The final mode is Challenge mode: it is an endless unwinnable mode where new bubbles are continuously added from the top. It is played for the high score: both the score and the number of bubbles popped are counted.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Sterling Sharpe: End 2 End</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-03-01</td><td>Jaleco USA, Inc.</td><td>Tose Co., Ltd.</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other), Top-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">End 2 End is a football game with the main attraction of it being that it has the personal endorsement of former Green Bay Packer, Sterling Sharpe.

In the midst of these reforms, rear admiral Jamitov (Zeta Gundam) forms the Titans, a pro-Earth group with a goal to enforce the will of the Federation on the Colonies. Due to the neglect, a rebellion begins in the Colonies, with the formation of the AEUG (Anti-Earth Union Group, also from Zeta Gundam).

In 1994, the signing of a Japanese star player by one of the league clubs came calling even more attention and enthusiasm, hence the release of few (Japan-exclusive) soccer games based solely in the Italian football league.Playable modes presented in the game include "Pre Match", "PK mode" and "League". In the latter one the player has to compete in the 1994‚Äì95 Serie A season which consists of 34 matches.The game scrolls horizontally at a slight angle and the players' sprites are cartoony (close to super deformed style). There's only one formation available (the default one), however the player has the option to position ten of the eleven players anywhere in the field. It is also possible adjusting the tactic to normal, defensive or offensive.During the matches there is a small scanner that shows the players' positions. A cutscene (animated image) will appear whenever a goal is scored. The goal celebration will always occur and very few players have their unique way of celebrating. There is a referee which will only show up when a foul is committed and sometimes he will show the yellow and/or red card. Only two substitutions are allowed, and many other "elements" are missing such as fatigue, injuries or the offside law.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Super Formation Soccer 95: della Serie A</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-03-31</td><td>Human Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Human Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Sports</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td>Masayuki Fujita (as M.

The fields themselves are facsimiles of actual Italian stadiums, with different grass types and home colors. At the beginning of a match in Serie A mode, a picture of the real-life stadium the field is based on is shown. The player can choose from 18 clubs, each with 22 players. However, each team can only have three foreign players (the initial release of this game preceded the "Bosman ruling" of 1995). Before a match begins, the player can choose different formations and whether the goalkeeper will be controlled automatically, semi-automatically or manually. There are six modes available: Exhibition, Serie A, Situation, Practice, Edit Team, and Option. Adding to the realism, the player can choose to play matches in Italian (menus will continue to be in either English or Japanese).

It features 700 major MLBPA players and has all 28 teams along with the complete 1994 roster, but doesn't feature an MLB license, instead the teams nicknames are omitted and team colors are altered.There are six modes to choose from: Exhibition, Home Run Derby, Defense Practice, Playoffs, League, that has the player compete against each team in the game in succession and Game Breaker which lets the player choose from 17 scenarios to win the game under certain conditions.  They can also choose different Division Champion line-ups that range from 1989-1993 or All-Star Lineups from 1989-1994.The graphics of the game are presented in a cartoonish-way and the stadiums are "authentic", but altered to distinguish themselves from the actual MLB stadiums.  The game doesn't feature a battery back-up like many other baseball games, but Series championships can be saved using passwords.  Jack Buck also lends his voice talent to the game calling play-by-play commentary.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">EarthBound</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-06-05</td><td>Nintendo of America Inc.</td><td>Ape, HAL Laboratory, Inc.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Regional differences</td><td>Comedy</td><td>Japanese-style RPG (JRPG)</td><td>Fantasy, Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td>2D scrolling, Isometric</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In the year 199X, in the village of Onett, on the continent of Eagleland...Young Ness was asleep one night when a loud crashing noise awoke him suddenly. As he rushes out of bed and up to a nearby hill, he encounters a strange meteor, carrying a single passenger: a mysterious insect-like being named Buzz Buzz. Buzz Buzz tells him that in the future, an evil alien being known as Giygas has conquered the world, and the only ones who can stop him are four young kids: three boys and a girl. Ness, of course, is one of the chosen ones, and he must find the other three children: Paula, a young girl with remarkable psychic powers, Jeff, a mechanical genius, and Poo, the young Prince of Dahlaam. Together, these four friends have the power to defeat Giygas and save the world from his chaotic reign!EarthBound is a sequel to Mother. It is a top-down role-playing game in which the heroes travel around Eagleland and various other, exotic countries, trying to end Giygas' evil influence. On the way, Ness and his friends will encounter a lot of enemies and battle them in turn-based combat. Unlike in the previous game, enemies are visibly walking on the screen. Each turn, each of the characters in the party can attack with their weapons, use a special ability (some characters have powerful psychic powers that can hurt enemies, heal comrades, and more; some also have some other, unique special powers), use an item or try and escape. The game features "rolling HP meters" - when a character is dealt damage, it's not all taken away from his HP right away, but instead his HP decreases slowly; if the combat is ended quickly, even a massively damaging attack can leave a character with only minor injuries. By winning battles, characters receive experience and thus become stronger. If the player-controlled characters are strong enough, weak enemies will escape from them instead of trying to attack; when chased down, they will be defeated instantly.Saving the game is done by finding a telephone and calling Ness' father. When the heroes defeat enemies, Ness' bank account receives money, which can be then retrieved from ATM machines throughout the game and spent in shops to buy better equipment or useful items. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Princess Minerva</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-06-23</td><td>Vic Tokai Corporation</td><td>Riverhill Soft Inc.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Top-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Princess Minerva is based on an anime of the same name. In the kingdom of Whistler, the best fighters are young, beautiful women, proficient in many styles of combat. Princess Minerva is one of them. She participates in a tournament, battles against the best female fighters of the country, and ultimately joins forces with them, building a super-powerful party that is bound to defeat the archenemy of the Queen of Whistler, the evil sorceress Dynastar.The game begins where the girls are already united and are getting ready for the grand quest. Your party contains nine girls, each one with various statistics and magic spells. The large party is divided into three smaller ones, and you switch between them while participating in random battles and fighting bosses. The combat is turn-based, and is viewed from a top-down perspective, like the locations you visit. You travel on the overworld map, visit towns, and descend into dungeons. The three active girls in your party can also unite to perform combo attacks. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Ruin Arm</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-06-23</td><td>Bandai Co., Ltd.</td><td>Plex</td><td>Action, Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Ruin Arm tells the story of a young boy named Arm, who lives together in Arff Village together with his father Borgan, his sister Linda, and the talking bird Lucia. Proud of the warrior traditions of their family, Borgan sends Arm to retrieve a powerful sword from the depths of the dungeon Arff. When Arm returns home, he finds the village attacked by soldiers from as hostile empire. His father loses his memory, and he has to find a magical herb to cure him. The king of Rondium and his court magician send Arm and Linda on a quest to find out more about the attack, and Arm discovers the secrets of the ancient Mediom empire and its evil emperor.This is an action RPG in which you control Arm and his party. You can either let the computer AI handle the actions of the other characters, or control them on your own, one at a time. In battles, characters have their own attacks: Arm uses physical attacks, Linda casts magic, etc. The dungeons are complex, and many of them have puzzles that you can solve by making two characters co-operate.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Der Langrisser</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-06-30</td><td>Masaya</td><td>Crosstalk Inc., NCS Corporation</td><td>Role-playing (RPG), Strategy</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Der Langrisser is an enhanced version of Langrisser II.Beside slightly improved graphical quality and a significant reduction of difficulty level, the main difference in this version is the player's ability to make moral decisions for the protagonist, which will subsequently influence the events of the narrative. In the original version, Elwin was only able to fight on the side of the Descendants of Light. In this release, Elwin also starts on this path; but as the game progresses, the player will be able to choose whether he should stay on it or side with the antagonists, the Rayguard Empire. Later, Elwin will be able to betray the Empire (in case he has chosen to help it) and support the Demon Tribe. It is also possible for Elwin to fight on neither side, and create his own faction instead.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Granhistoria: Genshi Sekaiki</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-06-30</td><td>Banpresto Co., Ltd.</td><td>J-Force</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>1st-person, Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td>Hitoshi Fukuchi</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">You are a young man named Toru, and you are about to marry Lu, your sweetheart.

Immediately afterwards you are attacked by thieves and are... killed? A mysterious World Sphere contacts your soul and brings you back to life. But you are sent to the world a few hours into the past, just before the thieves' assault on you and on the village. You have to prevent the assault, to stop a chain of events, and to change world history! As you venture into the thieves' hideout to find out more about their plans, you find yourself involved in a struggle between the thieves' leader and the king's generals, and soon realize you must play a very important role in the history of the world...The gameplay of Granhistoria is connected to its main concept: changing the history. At any time, you can read about the latest events of the history of the world through the menu. Your decisions in the game influence the course of those events. You can choose with which party to join forces, and thus to lead history in different directions. The combat in the game is turn-based, and the enemies you encounter are random.

It's also possible to fight in single matches, tournaments, Battle Royal and Elimination matches. The usual array of options in CAW is present, being possible to create 16 new Wrestlers.Gameplay, as usual is the series, is dramatically different than in most western games. Each wrestler has a bunch of moves, ranked from weak to strong. While it's possible to connect any of them from open situations, while grappling only when the opponent is already beaten the most powerful moves can be successfully used. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Secret of the Stars</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-07-01</td><td>Tecmo, Inc.</td><td>Tecmo, Ltd.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>1st-person, Diagonal-down</td><td>Regional differences</td><td></td><td>Japanese-style RPG (JRPG)</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">You are a young boy named Ray, who lives with his foster-father in a small country house on an island. But he can not enjoy his idyllic life for a long time. Ray is told about the evil wizard Homncruise, who plans to conquer the world. Defeating Homncruise won't be easy: first Ray must find the magic crest of his fallen father, and build a strong team of legendary warriors, named Aquitallion. Only then will he and his comrades be ready to face Homncruise and save the world.In this game you wander around the world map, visiting towns and dungeons, and fighting monsters in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, much like in Dragon Quest games. You'll have two parties at your disposal, and will be able to switch between them at any time. One party is the Aquitallion, the "main" one, and the only one which can access plot-progressing areas. The other parties can be used for visiting dungeons and retrieving valuable items. At a certain point in the game, you'll also be able to build and manage your own town.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Wild Guns</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-07-01</td><td>Natsume, Inc.</td><td>Natsume Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Rail shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic, Steampunk, Western</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">KABOOM!Annie & Clint, two gunslingers, arrive at Carson City and get caught up in a gunfight.

Our heroes flee the scene by climbing on the roof, but what's that sound? ... it's a HUGE robot!Wild Guns is a shooter with a western & Sci Fi theme. Gameplay is somewhat similar to the Time Crisis & House of the Dead games, with the exception that the game isn't played from a first-person perspective but from a third-person perspective. You control your on-screen character as well as the aiming crosshair (at the same time). Select either Clint (yes, inspired by Mr. Eastwood) or Annie and shoot down tons of enemies while dodging bullets and jumping over incoming rockets.After the Carson City level, the action continues in Desolation Canyon, an ammunition depot, a gold mine and a armored train (you can play these levels in any order). Finally there's a showdown with the big bad guy. Each of the 6 levels is divided into 3 sublevels. The 3rd one is always a boss-battle. During the game your standard weapon can be temporarily upgraded by collecting power-ups. If you want to create some serious mayhem you can detonate one of your bombs. Almost any object in the background can be destroyed.Wild Guns has a two-player co-op mode. There's also a shooting gallery mode in which you can't die; this one is all about scoring as many points as possible.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">NBA Give 'n Go</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-07-05</td><td>Konami (America), Inc.</td><td>Konami Computer Entertainment Osaka Co., Ltd.</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Arcade</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">NBA Give 'N Go is different from usual basketball games of the era because it is played at court level with the player with the ball.

Also, 2 characters and a mini police car are hidden.There are 2 modes to play in: Street Race, Vs Race. In the first mode player has to compete against 9 opponents along with chasing police. The second mode is a two-player split-screen one and it has 4 courses to select from.Some obstacles can be found on the roads, such as: whirls, jump-pads, pits, mud, ice, etc. Also, different power-ups are lying around (nitro boosts, bombs, spike traps, high heels, teddy bears, bags, barrels, etc.) to use them during the race.There is a small window displaying the driver and his or her reactions on various occurring situations.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">K≈çshien 4</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-07-14</td><td>Magical Company Ltd.</td><td>Magical Company Ltd.</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">K≈çshien 4 is a baseball goal that allows players to compete in a Japanese high school league.

On the outskirts of the town stands the Weathertop mansion. It was just an ordinary place until the last owner, Benedict Weathertop, started practicing black magic. He killed his parents and populated the mansion with all kinds of undead. Since then, nobody dared to approach the mansion. But a short while ago, two boys were found dead near this horrible place. Apparently, the boys had tried to enter the mansion. Another evidence pointed out that a girl followed them - but her body hasn't been found yet, and there is a slight hope she might be alive. This is where you, the hero of the game, decide to investigate the mystery, and to venture into the mansion...Laplace no Ma (Devil of Laplace) is a Japanese-style RPG with horror elements, somewhat similar to Sweet Home for NES. Unlike Sweet Home, this game is more oriented towards RPG gameplay. You are not stuck in the mansion, but can leave it, visit the town, and buy supplies. Later you also visit other locations such as a castle, etc. The battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. The hero of the game can recruit three other characters to the party of five available. Each character (including the hero, to whom you assign gender and class) belongs to one of the five character classes: Dilettante, Medium, Detective, Scientist, or Journalist. Dilettante is an all-around character with defensive magic, Medium is a kind of a black mage, Detective is a melee fighter, Scientist can construct powerful machines to perform various techniques, and the Journalist can take pictures of the monsters, which is the only way to gain money in the game.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Mystic Ark</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-07-14</td><td>Enix Corporation</td><td>Produce Co., Ltd.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Seven heroes from seven different Worlds.

But your main objective is to visit all the seven Worlds and to find seven mystic arks - the items that will re-unite those Worlds and bring peace to them.Mystic Ark is an RPG closely connected to 7th Saga. You travel on overworld map, visit towns, buy equipment, and descend into dungeons. The combat is turn-based and viewed from a third-person "over-the-shoulder" perspective.

The girls of the Jahana group who starred in the previous games return, with the new main protagonist being the young martial artist Yuka Takeuchi, who has been training in a secluded forest area before joining the competition. Like its predecessors, Advanced V.G. is a fighting game, with the basic "kick" and "punch" moves, while the various special attacks are executed by pressing combinations of buttons. There are three modes in the game, "Normal", "Vs.", and "Story". The normal mode is basically training matches between the player character and an AI-controlled girl. Vs. mode allows two-player mode, as well as demo "computer vs. computer" gameplay, with the possibility to choose any of the stages. Any of the nine heroines is available as a playable character in these modes (Yuka Takeuchi, Chiho Masuda, Jun Kubota, Manami Kusunoki. Kaori Yanase, Reimi Jahana, Satomi Yajima, Ayako Y≈´ki, and Erina Goldsmith). The story mode, on the other hand, allows the player to control Yuka Takeuchi only, and follow her story. Cut scenes advance the story between matches. The SNES received a stripped-down version, Super V.G., without the Story Mode and all explicit hentai elements. Hybrids (pair of bosses in Advanced V.G.) were also removed.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Go Go Ackman 2</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-07-21</td><td>Banpresto Co., Ltd.</td><td>Aspect Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Go Go Ackman 2 is mostly the same as its predecessor, with a few small tweaks.

Ackman still murders at whim and has his companion Godon collect the souls of his slain, but this time Ackman can keep the weapons he finds, either sword, boomerang, or gun. Each weapon can be upgraded twice, but upgrades will be lost if Ackman is hit or finds a new weapon.

Side quests: the three major side quests in the game have been removed and replaced by a new location, a Ghost Town, which contains a different sub-quest.
Dungeon layout: the dungeons are noticeably shorter and less complex than in the other versions.
Additional items: the dungeons also contain many more treasure chests.
Inventory: the inventory in this version is "bottomless", i.e. the party can carry an unlimited amount of items, as opposed to the earlier releases.
New attacks: the protagonist Atrushan has a set of new powerful dragon attacks.
Character growth: the characters gain much more HP when leveling up than in all the other versions.

Other blocks fall down from the top of the screen and have to be steered to the right place before touching the ground or another block. When four or more of the same blocks are together, they vanish. The catch of this variant is that the blocks which have to be removed move over the playfield.

However, the game has been altered in some ways. The most glaring change is that this version eschews turn based combat in favor of a more action oriented combat system. The Avatar also travels alone instead of being in a party of adventurers. Other changes include there being a smaller amount of items to pick up and the day and night cycle being only cosmetic instead of affecting the schedules of the NPC's.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Batman Forever</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-08-01</td><td>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Acclaim Studios Limited</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td>Martial arts</td><td>Beat 'em up / brawler, Platform</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Batman Forever is the officially licensed game based on the 1995 movie.

Many fighters answer the challenge to participate, including several of Ultratech's experimental warriors.  To increase the tournament's challenge, Ultratech utilizes a technology that can create bridges between alternate dimensions, releasing a creature known as Eyedol.  Eyedol is a two-headed ancient warrior that was imprisoned along with his bitter rival, Gargos. Some warriors enter the tournament to seek glory or escape.  Other fighters are attempting to bring an end to Ultratech's corruption.  Killer Instinct is a 2D versus fighting game that features 3D rendered sprite based graphics. Players choose from ten characters: Orchid, Cinder, Jago, Glacius, Fulgore, Riptor, Sabrewulf, Spinal, T.J. Combo, and Thunder. The game is known for its heavy combo-based fighting system, allowing players to pull off moves that land a high number of hits on their opponent, the highest being the "Ultra Combo". The game also features combo breakers, finishing moves and stage fatalities, double energy bars, and a dance-music inspired techno soundtrack.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">90 Minutes: European Prime Goal</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-08-04</td><td>Namco Limited</td><td>Namco Limited</td><td>Sports</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">90 Minutes: European Prime Goal is a soccer game with the 14 teams of the Japanese first division (J. League) to play with. In the European version they were replaced by national teams, but some playing modes are still reminiscent of the original. The available modes are exhibition matches, tournament, league, cup and all-star (the teams are divided into two leagues and the overall winner is decided with play-offs). With the option "You're a Hero", the player can create a new athlete, change his stats with a few training lessons and swap it with an existing one. The player either controls the athlete who has the ball or, when in defense, the one who is nearest to it.  The field is shown from a slightly angled side-perspective. During most modes, all teams can be taken over by human players, but only two can play at the same time.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Ch≈ç Mah≈ç Tairiku Wozz</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-08-04</td><td>Bullet-Proof Software, Inc.</td><td>Red Company Corporation</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td>Isometric</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The magic world of Wozz, populated by magicians, alchemists, and other kinds of people - including simple town and village inhabitants - was a seemingly peaceful place, until one day, a poisonous rain started turning its inhabitants into monsters.

At once they set off to track down the demon leaders.In Kishin Douji ZENKI: Battle Raiden the player takes the role of Zenki.

After Chiaki recovers her bracelet, or regains her concentration, or whatever she needs to do at the time, she can transform Zenki into his powered up form. In this form Zenki deals more damage and has a much longer list of attacks that get added to as the game progresses, such as a pillar of energy, an electrified punch, and a dashing attack. By picking up scrolls Zenki can do a powerful Rudora attack to all enemies on screen, but this attack damages Zenki as well.To complete platforming levels Zenki will have to make it to the end of the level while occasionally finding hidden stone monuments that, when destroyed, will drop items as well as alter the level or remove obstacles, allowing Zenki to pass. After a stage's first platforming level is a midboss fight, and after the second platforming level is the boss fight proper.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">BS Zelda no Densetsu</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-08-09</td><td>St.GIGA</td><td>Nintendo Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Metroidvania, Puzzle elements</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling, Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">A downloadable game for the Satellaview add-on for the Super Famicom, BS The Legend of Zelda is a remake of the original The Legend of Zelda for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
The game featured higher quality graphics and sound. Rather than playing as Link, you play one of the mascots of the BS-X Broadcasting System, and you can choose to play as a boy or a girl.The game could only be played for one hour each week for a total of four weeks. As a result, each hour needed to be completed in one sitting, or the player would have to quickly catch up the next week. Each hour included two available dungeons and some non-dungeon events, and blocked off certain areas that were not to be accessed until future weeks. The map of Hyrule from the original game was also cut in half, so the game was broadcast twice, once for each map.One key difference between the original and the remake is that in BS The Legend of Zelda, the Old Man periodically sends the player telepathic hints.

The player takes control of a young warrior named Ares, who wields a magical weapon - a powerful sword called the Planet Buster. One day, while traveling through a desert, Ares is captured by a warlock named Karl, who is after the powers hidden within the magical sword. Suspecting Ares might have some valuable information, Karl doesn't execute him, but takes away the Planet Buster and throws Ares into his underground prison. Now the primary goal is to guide Ares out of the huge prison full of various dangers, and get the mighty weapon back.The game is an action RPG with a heavy emphasis on dungeon crawling. The player guides Ares through rotating dungeons, fighting enemies in real-time combat, casting spells, and solving an occasional puzzle.

Upon his arrival, Crono meets a young girl named Marle, who volunteers to be the first to test Lucca's new device. However, Marle's pendant affects the teleporter's mechanism in a mysterious way, and as a result, she is teleported four hundred years into the past. Crono and Lucca quickly recreate the time portal and follow Marle. They find out that her unexpected appearance has created some confusion, and proceed to fix the error, which in turn leads to unforeseen consequences, eventually compelling the heroes to travel to different time periods and change the history of the world.Chrono Trigger is a Japanese-style role-playing game in which the player takes control of a party consisting of up to seven characters, developing the combat skills of its members and managing their equipment. There are no random encounters in the game: all the enemies are either visibly walking on the field maps and can be avoided by the player, or are waiting to ambush the party. No enemy encounters occur when the player navigates characters over the world map.The game utilizes the ATB (active time battle) combat system from  Final Fantasy games as one of the combat style selections offered to the player in the beginning. The other selectable battle mechanic pauses combat whenever the player accesses the menu, effectively removing the real-time element and rendering the battles fully turn-based.As the characters grow in power, their parameters increase, and they learn new "techs" - special powerful attacks and maneuvers which cost them magic points to use in battle. Techs may target a specific formation of enemies (e.g. a line) and can be used tactically depending on the enemies' positioning in combat. Characters may execute techs individually or perform double or triple techs, where each character contributes a tech which is combined with one or two others to unleash a powerful attack.Once player-controlled characters acquire the ability to travel freely between time periods, the game's plot develops in a non-linear fashion. From that point on the player may opt to face the game's final adversary in combat and complete the story, or perform other plot-related quests. Depending on the moment of the story when the player decides to proceed to the final battle, the game may be concluded with thirteen different endings. The New Game+ option allows the player to start the game anew after having previously completed it, carrying over levels, techs, and equipment of the characters. The PlayStation version features an anime-style introduction movie and cutscenes, a "movie theater" mode which allows the player to re-watch these movies and listen to the game's songs, as well as an unlockable bestiary, dungeon maps, and art gallery. The Nintendo DS version retains these changes and adds two new dungeons and a new possible ending that foreshadows the events of Chrono Cross.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Game no Tatsujin</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-08-11</td><td>Sunsoft</td><td>Alpha-Beta, Itsui, Success Corp.</td><td>Strategy</td><td>1st-person, Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Board game</td><td>Japan (Modern/Futuristic)</td><td></td><td>Point and select</td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Within Game no Tatsujin are four different classic Japanese board games made by different developers, which are Mahjong, Shogi, Go and Reversi.

After early successes, something goes wrong. It seems the scientists have opened a gateway straight to Hell. Phobos base is overrun with demonic creatures, and the whole of Deimos simply vanishes. A squad of marines is sent to Phobos, but all except one are quickly slaughtered. It falls to the surviving marine to grab some guns and strike back at the demons.id Software's follow-up to their genre-defining Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM is another first-person 3D shooter: full-on action as seen from the space marine's perspective. Like Wolfenstein, the game consists of distinct episodes, playable in any order. The first episode, Knee-Deep in the Dead, takes place in the Phobos base and is freely available as shareware. The full game continues on Deimos in The Shores of Hell and culminates in Inferno, the final episode which takes place in Hell itself (the Sega 32x version lacks this episode).The basic objective in each level is simply to reach the exit. Since dozens of enemies stand in the way, the only way to get there is by killing them. Switches and buttons must be pressed to advance at certain points and often color-coded locked doors will block the way - matching keycards or skull keys must be found to pass.The game's engine technology is more advanced than Wolfenstein's, and thus the levels are more varied and complex. The engine simulates different heights (stairs and lifts appear frequently) and different lighting conditions (some rooms are pitch black, others only barely illuminated). There are outdoor areas, pools of radioactive waste that hurt the player, ceilings that come down and crush him, and unlike Wolfenstein's orthogonally aligned corridors, the walls in DOOM can be in any angle to each other. An automap helps in navigating the levels.Stylistically, the levels begin with a futuristic theme in the military base on Phobos and gradually change to a hellish environment, complete with satanic symbols (pentagrams, upside-down-crosses, and portraits of horned demons), hung-up mutilated corpses, and the distorted faces of the damned.DOOM features a large weapon arsenal, with most weapons having both advantages and drawbacks. The starting weapons are the fists and a simple pistol. Also available are a shotgun (high damage, slow reload, not good at distances), a chaingun (high firing rate, but slightly inaccurate in longer bursts), and a plasma rifle (combining a high firing rate and large damage). The rocket launcher also deals out lots of damage, but the explosion causes blast damage and must be used with care in confined areas or it might prove deadly to the player as well as the enemies. Two further weapons in the game are the chainsaw for close-quarter carnage, and the BFG9000 energy gun, which while taking some practice to fire correctly, can destroy most enemies in a single burst. The different weapons use four different ammunition types (bullets, shells, rockets, and energy cells), so collecting the right type for a certain gun is important.The game drops some of Wolfenstein's arcade-inspired aspects, so there are no extra lives or treasures to be collected for points, but many other power-ups are still available. Medpacks heal damage while armor protects from receiving it in the first place. Backpacks allow more ammunition to be carried, a computer map reveals the whole layout of the level on the automap (including any secret areas), light amplification visors illuminate dark areas and radiation suits allow travel over waste without taking damage. Also available are berserk packs (which radically increase the damage inflicted by the fists) as well as short-time invisibility and invulnerability power-ups.The enemies to be destroyed include former humans corrupted during the invasion, plus demons in all shapes and sizes: fireball-throwing imps, floating skulls, pink-skinned demons with powerful bite attacks, and large one-eyed flying monstrosities called Cacodemons. Each episode ends with a boss battle against one or two, particularly powerful creatures.DOOM popularized multiplayer in the genre with two different modes: Cooperative allows players to move through the single-player game together, while Deathmatch is a competitive game type where players blast at each other to collect 'frag' points for a kill and re-spawn in a random location after being killed.The 3DO and Sega32x ports lack any multiplayer modes, though the other ports retain the DOS versions multiplayer to varying degrees. The various console ports all feature simplified levels and omit some levels, enemies, and features from the original DOS release. The SNES and Gameboy Advance versions of the game actually use different engines and hence feature numerous small gameplay differences.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Head-On Soccer</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-09-01</td><td>U.S. Gold Ltd.</td><td>U.S. Gold Ltd.</td><td>Sports</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Isometric</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In this isometric football game, 51 national teams are represented to play in two game modes: Exhibition and Tournament (a series of seven games on four continents, with a final against the World All-Stars), with the ability to set time, difficulty level, see cutscenes after goals and if players are free to kick each other around without (many) fouls.While the game seems short-featured for 1995 standards, the tournament mode includes a twist: depending on how well the player defeats his opponents, he can trade his "standard players", who won't do anything spectacular (but at least fill up the ranks) for star players, who not only look different, are able to cross and backheel the ball but also have a unique ability at the disposal of the player:
The Marker: can latch on an opposing player, stopping him from running away with the ball;
Goalkeeper 1: more capable of stopping shots than the regular goalkeeper;
Barger: this large, muscular player is able to shove everyone in his path;
Tricky: capable of jumping (or bunny-hopping, to be more precise) with the ball tucked between his feet, avoiding tackles;
The Cheat: while it's hard to talk about fair play in a game where kicking a defenders' leg to gain a corner is (mostly) a legitimate play, this player takes the whole thing into the next level, being able to dig fouls out of nowhere, at the expense of the ball (if he's carrying it or the referee waves play on) or just some stains in his shirt (if he's trying to pull an offensive foul), with the odds of 50/50 (25% for penalties);
Passer: capable of feeding forwards with laser-precision passes; 
Striker 1: capable of unleashing impossibly-sliced shots, scoring from virtually any position in the offensive area;
Striker 2: best used from positions directly in front of goal, this striker features a shot that is so powerful the ball ignites as it approaches the goal;
Goalkeeper 2: features a better chance of stopping special shots from both Strikers;In Exhibition games teams start with their own setup of start players, from none to a full team. The playing surface also affects gameplay - playing in wet grass removes all ball bounce, the opposite occurring with sand, and the most dramatic change, a rocky field where the ball can change direction after hitting the ground, turning throw-ins into corners, poor attempts on goals and vice-versa.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Kakinoki Sh≈çgi</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-09-01</td><td>ASCII Corporation</td><td>ASCII Corporation</td><td>Strategy</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Chess</td><td>Japan (Modern/Futuristic)</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The player participates in a classic Shogi board game hosted by champion Yoshikazu Kakinoki.

Though similar in style and appearance to Bomber Tekkyuu Fight differs in that its heroes use melee weapons, specifically a ball and chain.  There are numerous power-ups that not only increase its power but also its length and size.  Enemies can be stunned by jumping on their heads and you can flip tiles to achieve the same effect.  The ability to jump is heavily relied on in later stages to navigate each map and reach enemies before is up.  These features helped Super Tekkyuu Fight! differentiate itself from Hudson's series.The game features an extensive single player story mode that is nonlinear, complete with bosses at the end of each world.  Characters are drawn from all four heroes' respective series (with the exception of original character Fighter Roa) to add variety and depth.  There is also a multiplayer mode with 8 zones that feature their own unique hazards.  </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Bish≈çjo Senshi Sailor Moon: Another Story</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-09-22</td><td>Angel</td><td></td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>3rd-person (Other), Top-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The game is based on the Japanese manga and anime series Sailor Moon. It is set in the 30th century, in a futuristic city Crystal Tokyo. In this city lives a totally ordinary (at first) fourteen-year old girl Usagi. When she meets a magical cat named Luna, she finds out that she is in fact a princess sent to the future in order to fight the minions of Darkness. She discovers within herself the power to transform into the hero of darkness, Sailor Moon, meets other warriors who help her on her quest, and fights the evil Queen Beryl, hostile aliens, and other foes.The events of this game take place shortly after Bish≈çjo Senshi Sailor Moon S, the fourth volume of the long-running series. A global peace is established in the universe, but lately suspicious things are happening. A strange meteorite is seen approaching the Earth. Street gangs and spies who work for a mysterious person called Apsu are seen in Crystal Tokyo. And the Mystic Silver Crystal, the Ginzuishou, which protects the city, is shaking! Usagi and her friends must now investigate the strange events and face the forces of Darkness once again.The game is a Japanese-style RPG in Final Fantasy style (battles with your party to the right and the enemies to the left), with a battle system somewhat similar to that of Chrono Trigger: you must form a party out of several available characters, make them participate in battles together, and learn powerful combo attacks.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Ch≈ç Aniki: Bakuretsu Rant≈çden</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-09-22</td><td>Masaya</td><td>NCS Corporation</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Fighting</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The Ch≈ç Aniki series makes its debut on the SNES with all of its homo-erotic, pseudo-humorous, bizarre, sweaty bodybuilding charm, but with one major gameplay change.

After the battle with the Demon King (Daimaou) Piccolo, the twenty-third World Martial Arts Tournament is about to begin. But to the amazement of the hero Son Goku and his friends, their archrival Piccolo appears during the tournament, so that it quickly turns into a genuine battle.You control Son Goku and his son Son Gohan, switching between them as the game progresses. The game is basically an interactive comic book in which you can influence the story by choosing to press a button when the game prompts you to make a choice. You'll also participate in battles. The battle system is similar to rock-paper-scissors game, where one kind of move always beats or always loses to another.

Each enemy will drop a cooking ingredient when defeated, and at the end of each level two ingredients can be combined to make a meal that will restore some health based on if the chosen character likes it or not.

You play as Hamel, and with your violin can shoot musical notes to beat your enemies. However, you count with Flute‚Äôs aid. Flute follows you (although you can order her to stop and stay), but also can be grabbed and thrown at the enemies (yes, thrown at the enemies).

What he does not know is that the umbrella is magical! The moment he touches it, he is transferred to a parallel universe. Immediately, he is attacked by a huge tank, but a strange old man with a talking bird saves him. It seems that an evil creature named Dondera is threatening the country with the terrible monsters she created. But is it really so? You visit the capital town, talk to the emperor, and decide to investigate the matter...Holy Umbrella is essentially a platform action game, but unlike most other games of this genre, it allows you to visit towns, where you control your hero in a standard RPG-like top-down fashion. You can enter houses, talk to townspeople, etc. On platform levels, which are the main part of the game, you have to switch between the hero, the talking bird Bonto who accompanies you on your quest, and the girl Saki, whom you meet later in the game. Every character has his/her own special abilities and own ways of fighting: the hero can slide through air by using the umbrella, Bonto can double-jump on high ledges, Saki can jump on walls, etc. You use your umbrella as a weapon, as well as elemental stones you can collect on your way and throw at enemies.

A group of explorers ventures into the castle that where the king, the queen, and the wizard who created the pen used to dwell. Nobody knows what has been happening there for the last hundred years, since nobody dares to enter the haunted castle. As the heroes step in, the doors behind them close forever. They are left alone to discover the truth about the Cosmic Forge and the drama that occurred between the castle's inhabitants.Bane of the Cosmic Forge is the sixth entry in the Wizardry series. While retaining the basic premise of creating a party of up to six adventurers to roam first-person dungeons and fight enemies in turn-based combat, this installment contains numerous enhancements and new features. It is the first game in the series to feature full color graphics and a mouse-driven interface. Combat options are more detailed, with precise weapon moves (such as thrust and bash) available. Magic is divided into six different schools, the spellcaster's powers increasing if he or she concentrates on one of them. Picking locks or disarming traps by thief-like classes is done actively by participating in a simple minigame. Characters can learn skills unique to their class when leveling up. These skills range from weapon proficiencies to field abilities that can be used outside of combat.In addition to the traditional races of humans, elves, dwarves, hobbits, and gnomes, the player can choose between the Lizardman, the cat-like Felpurr, the canine Rawulf, the pixie-like Faerie, the intimidating Dracon, and the furry Mook. Each race has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as predispositions to certain classes. Exotic character classes such as Valkyrie, Alchemist, Psionic, Ninja, Samurai, and Monk are also available during character creation, though they require a higher amount of bonus points received during the initial dice roll. It is also possible for characters to switch to another class during the course of the game.Conversations with NPCs have been extended, the player being able to talk about various topics with the same character. The game also features a branching storyline: depending on the player's choice to believe or mistrust a key character, the plot will split into different directions, resulting in several different endings. The entire game takes place within the castle and its surroundings, without the possibility to travel back to the town or create other characters after the game has started. Unlike the previous entries, it is possible to save the game anywhere manually.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Seiken Densetsu 3</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-09-30</td><td>Square Co., Ltd.</td><td>Square Co., Ltd.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Action RPG</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Seiken Densetsu 3 is set in the same world as the two previous Seiken Densetsu games (the first is Final Fantasy Adventure, and the second is most known as Secret of Mana). The mysterious power of Mana is also the center of all events in Seiken Densetsu 3. Years have passed, and all the destructive powers of Mana have been securely sealed by Mana Swords into eight seeds, all placed in eight different kingdoms. But some people know about those sealed powers, and they don't want to free them for the sake of humanity, but for their own gain - such as the kingdom of Altena, which is slowly freezing and which can be saved only by the legendary powers.The game features several plot lines connected to each other by their common background. In the beginning of the game, you are offered to choose a group of three among six different characters of different classes: Duran the Fighter, Angela the Magic User, Lisa the Amazon, Carlie the Cleric, Kevin the Grappler and Hawk the Thief. Each one of them has her/his own background story and dwells in a different land. Gradually, the connections between those different characters become apparent, and the seemingly loose story lines are connected into a whole.Seiken Densetsu 3, like the previous game of the series, is an action RPG, with real time combat.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">BattleTech: A Game of Armored Combat</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-10-01</td><td>Activision, Inc.</td><td>Malibu Interactive</td><td>Action</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td>Mecha / giant robot</td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td>Isometric</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Take control of a Mad Cat 'Mech as you fight your way through several level of mechanized mayhem.

Once enacted, the dimensional bridge between the two realms connects, allowing Kahn's extermination squads to invade and destroy Earth, and enslave the population's souls.A small team of Raiden's "Chosen Warriors" survives the attack: Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang and his ally Kung Lao, Special Forces agents Sonya Blade and Jax, the shaman Nightwolf, the riot cop Stryker, the nomadic Kabal, and former Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero, who has gone rogue from his clan. Facing the warriors are the mercenary Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, Sheeva, a female Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, and Queen Sindel herself.Mortal Kombat 3 brings new elements to the 2D fighting series: multi-level playfields, "Dial-A-Combo" attacks, a "Run" button to speed up the battles, and "Vs." codes, which unlock new powers and abilities once both players enter a code sequence in pre-match-up screens. Also included are more stage fatalities and finishing moves as each warrior attempts to go one-on-one with the Centaurian enforcer Motaro, and Shao Kahn himself.Mortal Kombat 3 is the last traditional one-on-one fighting game game in the series to feature motion-captured digitized graphics for its kombatants, and introduces online network play to the PC version.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Secret of Evermore</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-10-01</td><td>Square Soft, Inc.</td><td>Square Soft, Inc.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Action RPG</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">A boy and his dog live together in the town of Podunk.

You are a leader of a nation. You begin in the Stone Age, and complete the game in the XXIth century (unless your civilization gets destroyed earlier). Your eventual goal is to become the dominant civilization in the world, either by wiping out everybody else, or being the first to get a space ship to Alpha Centauri.As the nation's leader, you have many responsibilities. You have to build cities, and then micromanage them, constructing various buildings. Most of people in your cities will be working on the neighbouring lands to get food (without it, your city won't survive or grow), production (used to build military units and buildings) and trade (which can be exchanged for money, science (see below) or luxuries that make people happy. You decide how much trade you want to invest into each of these areas.) You have to make sure that your people are in a good mood; if they get too unhappy, the city will collapse into disorder, and won't produce anything until you fix the situation. If you're ambitious, you can build Wonders of the World - epic constructions, such as the Pyramids or the Hoover Dam. Each Wonder is an unique thing, and only one of each can exist in the world. They give you a lot of benefits if you complete them, but they take a long time to build, and many of them will eventually stop working. There are other nations in the world, and there are also barbarians, so you'll have to invest into the military to protect yourself and to attack. Sure, you can sign peace treaties with other nations, and even exchange scientific knowledge with them (although sometimes they'll demand tribute from you), but eventually you'll probably have to fight. You control each of your military units on the world map, attacking your opponents' units and cities (possibly taking over them). Not all units are for combat though. Settlers are used to build cities, create roads (for easier travel of your units) and improve the land around cities, increasing production. Diplomats can be sent to foreign cities to negotiate with the other nations or create embassies, but they can also bribe enemy units to join you and conduct espionage and sabotage in the enemies' cities. Caravans can be sent to faraway cities to increase trade in their home city, and they can also help in building Wonders of the World. Scientific progress is an important part of the game. The more science your cities produce, the faster you research new technologies. Initially, you'll be finding out about the wonders of Alphabet or Bronze Working, but late in the game you'll be researching Computers and Robotics. Most technologies give you some new units, buildings and other things, although some have more interesting effects - for example, after inventing the Automobile, you'll find out that your citizens started producing pollution. Pollution is a bad thing; if there's too much of it, global warming may occur. How your cities prosper depends partially on the type of government that your nation has. Initially you're living in Despotism, but this can stunt growth of your civilization, so it's a good idea to switch to something else - Monarchy, Republic, Democracy or Communism. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-10-01</td><td>Nintendo of America Inc.</td><td>Nintendo Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The events of Yoshi's Island take place in the past.

The Yoshis decided to carry baby Mario and to bring him to his parents. But Kamek has sent troops and hordes of monsters to stop the Yoshis and to kidnap Mario.In the game, players control the differently colored Yoshis most of the time. Mario is a helpless baby unless a star that makes him invincible is collected. As a Yoshi, players can swallow enemies to make eggs; these eggs are used for attacking other enemies and activating switches. Yoshi can do a flutter jump to clear large gaps that a regular jump can't. Players can also pound the ground for attacks and also flipping certain switches. Additionally, Yoshis can transform into vehicles, such as a helicopter, submarine, or train. If Mario is dismounted from a Yoshi, a countdown will start, and Yoshi must catch the baby before Kamek's servants kidnap it.

A young boy named Ark grew up in Crysta, the only remaining village on the Darkside. One day, he and some other boys hear mysterious voices coming from beyond a door the village elder forbade them to open. Unable to resist their curiosity, the boys open the door, and Ark finds a box with a strange creature inside. By opening the box, Ark inadvertently causes all the villagers to be turned into stones. In order to bring them back to life, Ark has to find five towers within the dangerous Darkside and eventually restore life on the surface of the planet.Terranigma is an action role-playing game.

When you wake up, you find out that Japan is floating in the air, and is attacked by a mysterious force that spawned countless demons who brought destruction to the cities. People are hiding among rubble and in underground passages. Some of them are fighting the demons, joining an organization called Self-Defense Forces.

The party members are selected on a separate screen before each battle, and as the game progresses new characters become available.During the skirmish, selecting the characters brings up a menu with three command options: move, attack or end turn. A fourth transform option becomes available later, after they reach a higher level. When moving or attacking, glowing tiles on the ground show the maximum range of the action. Performing either one costs action points, shown as eight regenerating green dots on the status window, alongside basic statistics like health, defense and attack levels. Characters level up automatically while on the battlefield, increasing their abilities and receiving more powerful attacks. Health powers are also accessed through the attack menu, recovering lost points to an ailing comrade within their range.

It retains the same gameplay and humorous elements that substantiated the first two games. Gameplay itself is a parody of Konami's famous Gradius series; the screen scrolls from left to right (most times) and the player manoeuvres a flying character around the screen destroying waves of enemies and avoiding obstacles. Unlike previous Parodius titles, this game contains a difficulty adjustment option, allowing the player to make things easier or harder. Also unique to this installment are bits of digital voice acting. Survival throughout the level leads the player to a boss fight, which frequently includes some of the strangest characters in the game. Power-ups include, besides the standard version (red, used to upgrade weapons), the shield power-up (blue) and a variety of different coloured bells. Green Bells will make the protagonist huge on the screen; Yellow Bells are worth points (points in turn are worth extra lives); Blue Bells are "big bombs" that clear the screen of enemies and can be saved until you need them; White Bells will give the player character a megaphone that will shout out phrases that damage enemies; Red Bells stockpiles the hero with three point-defense lasers, only one of which can be activated at a time and disappears after a short while; Purple Bells will clear the screen of all but the strongest enemies, turning them into power-ups.This time around there are sixteen different characters to chose from, each with unique power-ups and weapons. These include familiar faces from earlier games as well as new ones: Vic Viper, the "gradius ship" equipped with its traditional Gradius weapons; Pentaro from Penguin Adventure, whose Potion weapon may now hit multiple enemies and his normal weapon shots explode against obstacles; Soitsu, a green stickman surfing aboard a paper airplane, whose laser weapon is able to charge up to deliver more power and who drops little stickmen onto the ground which occasionally dance around rather than attacking; Mike, a cute little kitten who happens to to have a very powerful wave weapon which can travel through obstacles and enemies, as well as a multiple bomb ability which requires his "upgrade ability"; Memim, a flying fairy in bikini who carries missile weapons whose direction is determined by her current location on the screen when fired; Tako, the flying octopus wearing a baseball cap; Upa, the flying baby with a Mega Crush ability that destroys all enemies on screen, and others.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Nichibutsu Arcade Classics 2: Heiankyo Alien</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-12-15</td><td>Nichibutsu</td><td></td><td>Compilation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Nichibutsu Arcade Classics 2: Heiankyo Alien is the follow-up to the Super Famicom Nichibutsu Arcade Classics and features two games: a port of the original 1979 arcade game Heiankyo Alien, and a "new type mode" game that reimagines it with updated 16-bit graphics and sound.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Tales of Phantasia</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1995-12-15</td><td>Namco Limited</td><td>Wolf Team</td><td>Action, Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Side view, Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In Tales of Phantasia the player controls a young boy named Cless, who lives together with his parents in a quiet village.

A typical button masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m hurdles, pole vault, long jump, triple jump, javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and archery) and 32 countries around the world compete in custom or full Olympics, or just practice. Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events, and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre.Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction can earn world record times. Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests, three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps.The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping events, although trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three throws, the top eight allowed three more attempts.Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be calculated according to the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards and compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed directly at the "gold" points). Skeet is a five round competition where the goal is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with two slugs for each. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Oscar</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996</td><td>Titus France SA</td><td>Flair Software Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In Oscar the player controls the eponymous protagonist through seven levels in Hollywood-style areas (Science Fiction, Western, Horror, Cartoons, Dino, Detective and Gameshow), each divided into three scenes.

The game contains multiple, often humorous endings. Gameplay is something between a standard text adventure and a visual novel. Rather than having a full array of possible actions, players are limited to the several options it presents at any time.  With newly discovered items and information, new areas can be reached.

The basic plotline is the same: Professor Cuthbert Calculus gets kidnapped and the player, in the role of Tintin, needs to rescue him. The rest is more loosely adapted: in contrast to the comic, which is mostly based in Peru, this game offers many different locations all over the world.The gameplay itself is a typical platforming action: Tintin walks through the levels while avoiding the enemies. Pretty much everyone, e.g. little girls and security guards, is out to hurt Tintin who has no means of defending himself. This means the most important aspect is learning enemy placements, their patterns and how to avoid them. But he has to hurry because of the time limit. Required for success is the usage of the two playing plains: from the player's perspective in the foreground and further towards the background. Tintin can switch between the two at any time.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">The Smurfs Travel the World</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996</td><td>Infogrames Europe SA</td><td>Virtual Studio</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Night falls at the Smurf Village.

Now they must face the challenges in all continents in order to retrieve all shards of the Crystal and return home.A classic platformer, this title allows the player to choose between Inquisitive Smurf and Smurfette (there are no differences between characters) and collect all 10 shards scattered on the playfield.  There is a larger emphasis on exploring the levels rather than killing enemies (no score is given for them), so they can be avoided in most occasions, but if the needs arise, be dealt with a kick or in Mario fashion by jumping over them. Some shards can only be obtained by jumping on an enemy, using the sprint jump or using the scenario (ropes, or vines). While large falls don't harm the Smurfs, improper contact with enemies does. Each 1-up has four hearts, and at the fifth contact a life is lost and the player must restart the level. Once all lives are lost, the game is over - there are no continues. To fill the meter there are hearts and small Smurf icons scattered or hidden somewhere in the level, and on all stages there's a key that unlocks a bonus level if all three are collected at the end of the continent. In these bonus levels the player collects as much objects as possible which translate into hearts when the time closes. If the player fills the meter, a 1-up is awarded. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">War 3010: The Revolution</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996</td><td>Advanced Productions, Inc.</td><td>Advanced Productions, Inc.</td><td>Strategy</td><td>1st-person, Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">An alien race named Kyllen has enslaved humanity.

War 3010 is a turn-based strategy game in which players move spaceships over a grid-map. There are different types of ships, such as Fighters, Marauders or Destroyers, that differ in movement range and weapon power. Weapon power is also divided into long and short range, i.e. a ship that is very good at long range combat may have poor close ranged weapons etc. During combat, the following actions can be chosen from a menu: Movement, Attacking, terrain information, unit information, a map of the battlefield, overview of all units, including those of the enemy; and an option to scout planets for technology. When an attacking unit is within range of an attacked unit, the attacked unit will always counter-attack (if it isn't destroyed first). In later missions it becomes possible to scout planets for technology and upgrade ships, as well as take control of space stations to build new ships. Ships cannot be taken into the next mission however.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Whizz</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996</td><td>Titus Software Corporation</td><td>Flair Software Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td>Isometric</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Whizz is one of the few 3D platformers to use an isometric viewpoint.

Each level is played out against a time limit, and the paths through the level aren‚Äôt always clear-cut. There are four different types of doors, each of which needs a particular icon to pass (the icons represent the door type, such as ice or bricks, rather than hot water or a key, or anything you‚Äôd logically expect to clear the path). You can avoid the baddies, which may be the best option, as killing them costs you some energy ‚Äìthis reduces the significance of the points system.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Winter Gold</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996</td><td>Nintendo Co., Ltd.</td><td>Funcom Oslo A/S</td><td>Action, Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Winter Gold is a winter sports game with events like bobsled, ski jump and snow boarding, all in a 3D graphics environment.Both single player and multi player options are available; you can play with up to eight people in compete mode.

Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends. There are a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which are affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, airstrikes, and utilities such as ropes and girders.There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land and the moon (complete with affected gravity).

It seemed that they only wanted the end of Japan's isolation from the rest of the world. But their true purpose was to take control of a mysterious Japanese energy source called reiketsu. To protect those sources, that were running dry during their three hundred years-long reign, the Tokugawa Shoguns formed the famous Shinsengumi special force. In addition to its primary mission of clearing out forces that would try to overthrow the shogunate, there also existed a special branch of them called "Shadow Shinsengumi". The duty of the "Shadow" was to take care of "those things the human hand cannot manage"...You control Yamatomaru, a strong-willed sixteen-year-old boy who lives in Iida village, near Koufu. His father has recently passed away. After failing to defeat a monster in his village, he was saved by one of the Shadow Shinsengumi man, Mibu Juurota. As he receives his father's katana, he goes on his first mission - rescuing boys who were trapped in a mountain path. Soon the plot thickens and the young hero becomes involved in mystical struggles between the forces who try to control reiketsu...The gameplay is similar to Dragon Quest  series and other Japanese-style RPGs: the battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. You fight using physical attacks and a variety of special moves based on spiritual energy. An unusual addition to the gameplay is the karma system. By doing good deeds you can increase your karma level, in an Ultima-like way. This way you get more money and precious items from fighting monsters, and your special powers increase in strength. If you don't show compassion, steal people's things and lie, your karma will decrease, you won't get money from random battles, and some people will attack you. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Bahamut Lagoon</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-02-09</td><td>Square Co., Ltd.</td><td>Square Co., Ltd.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG), Strategy</td><td>Diagonal-down, Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The kingdom of Kahna is in great danger.

If only the strongest of the dragons, Bahamut, could be awakened...Bahamut Lagoon is a tactical role-playing game. The player controls several parties of four characters each, and commands different dragons at once. The battles start on a top-down screen typical for strategy games, but often switch to a dynamic side view, such as often used in Japanese-style RPGs. The outcome of some battles can also be affected by other tactical decisions, such as, for example, setting a whole forest on fire to prevent enemies from coming through it.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Tokimeki Memorial: Densetsu no Ki no Shita de</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-02-09</td><td>Konami Co., Ltd.</td><td>Konami Co., Ltd.</td><td>Adventure</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td>Romance</td><td>Dating simulation, Japanese-style adventure, Visual novel</td><td>Contemporary</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Setting</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Tokimeki Memorial: Densetsu no Ki no Shita de ("Beneath the Tree of Legend") is a port of the highly popular Konami dating simulation game, compressed into a 32-megabit Super Famicom cartridge and based on the original 1994 PC-Engine CD version (as opposed to the enhanced PS1 port "Forever With You", which contained additional content).

The government alliance that had supported the building of ATLAS now find themselves facing economic crisis as the balance of power shifts. In this world of conflict and change, the Walking Panzer, or Wanzer, (a form of mecha) becomes the standard armored unit for wars and petty battles across the globe. For the small nation of Bergen, a coup d'etat is underway, staged by Colonel Ark. Seeking to establish complete control over the government and the NORAD units stationed there, Ark's first step involves the capture of President Orwen. Tipped off to the rebellion, Orwen seeks to flee from Bergen, looking for safe passage out of the seaport of Port Ertothal. A young Wanzer pilot, Albert Grabner, is assigned escort duty to the president by loyal elements of the army stationed there...Gun Hazard is a side-scrolling shooter with strong RPG elements, and a spin-off of the Front Mission series. Gameplay is more than a little similar to Cybernator or Metal Warriors. The player moves between different stages on an area map. Once inside a stage, the player controls Albert and his wanzer as it moves left, right across the screen. The wanzer is able to jump, and attack with a primary and a special weapon. At any time during a stage, Albert can eject from his heavily armed wanzer to explore. Although vulnerable when outside, Albert is able to reach areas the wanzer cannot, in addition to being a smaller target and being able to jetpack indefinitely.Money and experience are earned through the completion of mission objectives as well as the kill count of enemy wanzers. Additionally, Albert can recruit other characters through the normal course of the story, some of whom can be designated to support roles. These support characters when set can provide a variety of different cover fire abilities for Albert during his missions. They too gain experience and levels. Different weapons and armor can be found or bought. Essential components include the Booster ability which allows the wanzer to hover and increase its jumps, as well as the Dash ability which allows quick left-right movement by the wanzer. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Cutthroat Island</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-03-01</td><td>LJN, Inc.</td><td>Software Creations Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Fighting</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In this game you play the role of a pirate lady called Morgan who was given a piece of a map by her father before he died.

However, when Mario goes to Bowser's Keep to save her, a giant sword made by the evil Smithy crashes into the castle and sends Mario, the Princess, and Bowser flying to separate parts of the world.The game plays much like a traditional RPG: Mario and the members of his party gain experience points by defeating enemies. These experience points can increase the team's maximum number of hit points and flower points (magic points). The battles are also turn-based, but this time there are timed attacks and defenses. Timed attacks allow you to inflict more harm than normal to an enemy. Timed defenses, on the other hand, allow an enemy to inflict less harm than normal. You are only allowed to have three out of five team members on your party at a time. Mario is always in your party, regardless.

As mentioned you can create summon rooms to invoke creatures that can aid you in combat, help you gather energy and other resources, etc.Depending on how you place you rooms according to certain Feng Shui principles you get bonuses and upgrades and you will also face cave-dwelling monsters that you must defeat and other non-player characters (NPCs) that may or may not aid you.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Do Re Mi Fantasy: Milon no DokiDoki Daib≈çken</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-03-22</td><td>Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.</td><td>Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">A young boy named Milon sets off to save Alis, his fairy friend, after she was captured by the evil sorcerer Amon.

For millennia, the Holy Kingdom of Langran ruled over the lands of La Gias with its long, proud history and an unprecedented level of technology. However, the days of the kingdom are numbered. Seers and scholars predict that the mighty state will fall in the next 10 years, thus bringing forth the destruction of their world. In an effort to stave off such a terrible prediction, Langran produces powerful machines, called the Masou Kishin, powered by pilot's sheer willpower, called "prƒÅna". The majority of the people of Langran however, do not possess enough willpower to control these giant mechanical beings. In their last ditch effort, the kingdom summons a few people from the Surface (Earth). Among them is Masaki And≈ç, a man that will rise to the challenge of putting an end to an almost invincible evil.Masou Kishin The Lord of Elemental is the first Super Robot Wars/Taisen game that does not feature any licensed franchises; instead, it tells the story of the original characters that were previously introduced in SRW 2, 3, EX and 4. Like its contemporaries, it is a turn-based tactical RPG game. The player goes through a comprehensive campaign, battling against enemies and leveling up their units. After battles, players can upgrade their units' stats. Alongside the battles, players experience the story through the eyes of the main protagonist and make important choices that can have an impact on how the story plays out.While the core gameplay remains relatively the same as that of the previous classic Super Robot Wars/Taisen titles, Masou Kishin introduced a number of features that would be implemented in later games of the franchise. For one, the graphics are vastly enhanced: robots are represented in actual proportions during battle, instead of the "super-deformed" look of the previous titles. The battlefield is now in isometric position, compared to the top-down view of the previous titles. The isometric view also allows for more tactical depth: units attacking from behind deal greater damage than attacking from the front. Terrain also affects unit stats that can give a notable advantage over the enemy.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Bish≈çjo Senshi Sailor Moon Super S: Zenin Sanka!!

The game introduces ≈åsama, who is the king of Subcon, and his assistant.

Another addition is that in each level, after defeating its boss, the player must locate and defeat Wart, who is found in every level by traveling down a vase while in Subspace. If there is still time left on the timer after all goals in an episode are completed, the player may explore any levels as much as they want before time runs out.

Many years ago, four great races dominated the Earth: the wise Danans, the beautiful Mermaids, the proud Reptiles, and the strong Giants. But those races had to give place to a newly born race: the humans. During the era of the humans, the planet's air has become filled with smog and the water dirty with pollutants. The cult of the Rudra have appeared and begun foretelling the end of the world. As the 4000 year deadline approaches, three characters each embark on their separate yet intertwined quests.

Sion is a young warrior who wants to take part in a ritual tournament and become the strongest of the kingdom. However a capture of one of the Cultists of Rudras soon complicates his training.
Surlet is a wise magician who is interested in archeology and history of the Earth. He is also a pupil of the famous professor Muench who recently made a very important discovery regarding ancient ruins
Riza is a young druid who lives with her grandfather in a quiet village. She was born with a mysterious jade on her forehead, and now feels the urge to save the world from an inevitable, yet unknown disaster.

Rundra no Hih≈ç is a turn-based RPG, similar in gameplay and graphics to the better known Final Fantasy VI. Whenever players load the game cartridge, they are able to  choose which of the three characters they wish to play. This allows any one of these quests to be saved and put aside for any amount of time, allowing the player to change between characters as they so desire. Regardless of which character is chosen, the game is displayed as a top-view on the overworld and in towns. Players can move around to different locations, search treasure chests and talk to townspeople. On the overworld and in dungeons, random encounters can occur. During battles the game is displayed from a side-view and is turn-based between the player's characters and monsters. Players are able to Fight with their weapon, use mantras (magic), use items, defend or run away. Defeat of monsters will result in the party earning experience points and money, which can be spent to buy new weapons, armor and items.The game's mantra (magic) system is unique in that all spells are formed up of syllables, each with it's own effect (for instance, the syllable "Ig" represents fire and the syllable "ga" augments any mantra's power over it's basic form. Therefore "Igga" is a more powerful version than "Ig" alone). Syllables must be arranged in proper combinations in order to form effective magic spells. Hints towards some of these combinations can be found inside treasure chests or by talking to townspeople.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Mah≈çjin GuruGuru 2</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-04-12</td><td>Enix Corporation</td><td>TamTam Co., Ltd.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Real-time</td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Mah≈çjin GuruGuru 2 is an action-RPG from Enix that stars two children, Kukuri and Nike, a brother and sister.

Seisen no Keifu also featured much larger maps than previous titles (though a lower number of them -- 12 in all) and a handful of new units, such as the Troubadour, Dragon Master, and Falcon Knight.

The game is divided into chapters, and each chapter is played by either Roda or Rukyu. You switch the two heroes chapter-after-chapter, and lead them to their ultimate battle from two opposite sides. The entire game, including the battles, is viewed from an isometric perspective. The battles are random and turn-based, and the battle field is divided into squares you can position and move your characters on.

Next to fastball and curveballs, there are six different pitches such as Super Fast, Screwball, Super Curve, Slider, Change Up and Knuckleball.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Arabian Nights: Sabaku no Seirei-≈ç</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-06-14</td><td>TAKARA Co., Ltd.</td><td>Pandora Box</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Japanese-style RPG (JRPG)</td><td>Fantasy, Middle East</td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Arabian Nights: Sabaku no Seirei-≈ç is a Japanese role-playing game released for the Super Famicom. The game starts with the Djinn Ifrit being defeated by a sorcerer named Suleiman. Suleiman then makes Ifrit his servant. One day Suleiman is defeated by a mysterious sorcerer, robbing Ifrit from the opportunity to take revenge on the man that enslaved him for so long. With his last strength Suleiman seals Ifrit in a magical ring and so gives him the opportunity to take revenge on the person that robbed him of his revenge. The game follows a girl named Shukran who finds the ring containing Ifrit helps him to regain his power and seek revenge on the mysterious sorcerer who defeated his master and ultimately grant his freedom.Arabian Nights employs a turn-based battle system that is traditional with a unique hook. Elemental barrier cards alter the entire playing field and affect both players and enemies alike. Cards come in one of nine attributes and five levels, with higher levels producing greater effects. Both players and enemies can lay down barrier cards to swing the battle in their favor.The game is nonlinear to a great extent. The main objective is to collect all of the elemental crystals and restoring Ifrit to full power. The order these are done is left to the player. Compared to most role-playing games Arabian Nights is short at 10-15 hours but does have multiple endings depending on your actions.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">K≈´s≈ç Kagaku Sekai Gulliver Boy</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-06-28</td><td>Bandai Co., Ltd.</td><td>Amble Ltd.</td><td>Action, Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Top-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">K≈´s≈ç Kagaku Sekai Gulliver Boy is one of the games based on the anime series Gulliver Boy, quite different from the  PC Engine CD game of the same name.

These sequences give the player a play area in which color-coded "puyos" are pre-arranged in different patterns, and the player must position and arrange the ones that start to fall in order to fulfill the objective at hand (clear only a certain row or color of puyos, reach a certain number of combos, etc.). Additionally, running into specific monsters can trigger standard Puyo Puyo duels, in which both players have their own play areas and the objective is to clear the screen faster than the opponent.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Bass Masters Classic: Pro Edition</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-07-01</td><td>Black Pearl Software</td><td>Black Pearl Software</td><td>Simulation, Sports</td><td>Top-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This game is basically an update to Bass Masters Classic.

A strange disease has plagued the town and its inhabitants plead the healers of Clatos to help them. Milly's father decides to go, but he himself catches the disease. The young adventurers must save Milly's father and other people at all costs. But in the beginning of their journey, they discover a crashed space ship with people who belong to a much more advanced civilization. People from two different worlds must work together to solve the grand mystery.Star Ocean is a Japanese-style role-playing game that contains some stand-out features, such as Approval Rating: people like or dislike each other and their behavior towards Ratix and within the party might change depending on their feelings to him and your own actions. The combat is fast-paced, real-time: the player controls Ratix, while other party members are AI-controlled. It is possible to customize combat tactics by assigning roles to the protagonist's companions, and pause the combat at any time to make strategic decisions.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Energy Breaker</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-07-26</td><td>Taito Corporation</td><td>Neverland Co., Ltd.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Japanese-style RPG (JRPG), Tactical RPG</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Energy Breaker is set on a small, fictitious island called Zamuria. The story begins with Myra, a 21-year-old girl who has lost her memory. She keeps having dreams warning that she must hurry to avert a catastrophe. After visiting the fortune-teller Selphia who has just come to the Myra's town, she finds herself drawn into a conflict between four mysterious Dark Generals who are seeking the power of four jewels. With the local inventor Renard and his robot assistant Gulliver, they embark on a time-travelling adventure to meet new allies, uncover her forgotten past, and learn of the Dark Generals' plot that may threaten the world.Energy Breaker is hinted to take place in the same world as Taito's Lufia series: for instance, the presence of Priphea flowers, some terminology and conventions, an obtainable sword named after the Dual Blade, and a cameo appearances by Lufia and Roman in the ending.Energy Breaker combines gameplay elements from traditional Japanese role-playing games and strategy/tactical role-playing games. The player is able to explore dungeons and towns from the same isometric perspective of the game's battle system. The game features many hidden items that can be found by interacting with the background environment, as well as a staggering amount of descriptive text for the environments that change throughout the course of the game, often several times. The player is able to choose an emotion or attitude when talking to NPCs, however this rarely seems to make a difference. Dungeon exploration transitions seamlessly into episode-like grid-based battle scenarios with preset enemy layouts and conditions as opposed to random encounters. Battles are typically won by defeating all enemies, though other win conditions exists such as defeating a boss, surviving a certain number of turns, or arriving to a specific point of the battle grid.The battle mechanics are based around a "Balance" component. Player characters and enemies all receive an amount of Balance at the start of their turn, however the less HP a unit has, the less they will receive at the start of that turn. Balance is required to perform most actions, such as moving, performing basic and special attacks, and using items. Special attacks and skills are learned by finding and using "Grimoire" items before battle, and are equipped according to an energy system that consists of four types: blue, red, yellow, and green. One energy type may be leveled up once per level up, up to a maximum of eight. Before they can be used, special skills require the character to meet a specific minimum level of each of the four energy types, which themselves can be continually adjusted throughout the game.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Lennus II: F≈´in no Shito</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-07-26</td><td>Asmik Ace Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Fill in Caf√© Co., Ltd.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>1st-person, Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This is a follow-up to the game "Lennus", which is known outside of Japan as Paladin's Quest. The game is set in a world of Andell - a floating continent where ancient prophecies and highly advanced technology co-exist. A curse has fallen onto Andell - its four island, once united, are now separated, and are floating away from the heart of the continent, the temple of Andell. The sages of the temple summon a great hero named Farse, who must find a special magic orb for each one of the islands, which is the only way to re-unite them. Farse embarks on his journey, aided by three Terranos, the big-eared inhabitants of Andell.This is a Japanese-style RPG where you control a party containing the main hero Farse and three Terranos you select out of the available five. You encounter random enemies and bosses and fight them in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. You can use special attacks and magical spells, which don't consume magic points, but take away a certain amount of your hit points. Instead of healing items, you have mini-bottles you can refill with potions in special places in towns. You can equip various magical artifacts which will allow you to use magic spells belonging to eight different elements.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">SimTown</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-07-26</td><td>Imagineer Co., Ltd.</td><td>Maxis Software Inc.</td><td>Simulation</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>City building / construction simulation, Managerial / business simulation</td><td>Contemporary</td><td></td><td>Point and select</td><td></td><td></td><td>Free-roaming camera, Isometric</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">SimTown is one of several entries in the city-building simulation series, SimCity. As in prior installments, players are tasked as the mayor of a newly formed municipality, taking charge of it's expansion and success. Being aimed at a younger audience than that of the other games within the series a greater emphasis is placed on managing a small, socially ideal town than a sprawling metropolis. As such it features a much more stylized, cartoon representation and user interface, a number of added features allowing for greater interactivity with the populace, and a simplified system of resource management.As their first priority as mayor players will simply need to construct a town, supplying not only housing for their residents but employment, schools, and civic buildings as well; Roadways and bike paths being needed to connect them all. While each building has its own associated costs and benefits they're often marginal enough that a player's selection will often be as much an aesthetic consideration as a functional one. In order to finance all of this consideration will also have to be paid to the player's limited resources of water, wood, and crops, which rejuvenate only so quickly.Interacting with the populace will also be crucial to success. Individual citizens will often offer suggestions and make demands of the mayor and so a close eye will have to be kept on their opinions of how the city is being run. Those that favor specific types of restaurants will request them and objections will be made if the city is lacking in their preferred form of recreation. Players can also take a closer look at their residents by 'removing' the tops of buildings and peering inside, watching their life unfold on a more minute scale. Specially constructed designer characters can also be made to populate the town, built to pre-defined specifications such as their preferred clothing and personal preferences.A number of awards can be gained within the game for exemplary achievements resulting from maintaining a balanced town for some period of time. An in-game newspaper will assist in these efforts by helping to keep the player up to date on what might be wrong in their city, or how they might be succeeding.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Spriggan Powered</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-07-26</td><td>Naxat Soft</td><td>Micronics, Kaga Tech</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td>Mecha / giant robot</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Spriggan Powered is a sci-fi side-scrolling shoot 'em up and the third game in the Spriggan series.There are 6 stages in the game and the player, controlling a flying mech, has to make his way forward defeating enemies, middle bosses and final bosses on every stage.

One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800, and 1600, progressively).

In most of them Kirby can consume monsters and learn their special abilities, but in Milky Way Wishes abilities are instead collected in a manner similar to Metroid games. Offensive Cave features levels with various obstacles, hidden treasures and some elementary lever-pulling kind of puzzle solving. Metaknight's Revenge is the only game on the cartridge with a (fairly strict) timer.  The Arena is a "boss rush" mode, asking players to defeat every boss in the game with limited health refills and on one life.The game also has a two-player cooperative play option, which has given it a reputation of a party game.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">PGA European Tour</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-09-01</td><td>Black Pearl Software</td><td>Halestorm, Inc.</td><td>Simulation, Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">European Tour is best thought of as a remake of the original game, rather than a sequel as such.

All his life he wanted to meet a real fairy, and now, when the opportunity has come, he firmly decides to find her. His girlfriend Tia helps him on the dangerous journey, during which they meet a mysterious little girl named Chitta, and get involved in a grand adventure, that will ultimately lead them to the battle against the dark force that threatens the whole Monstania!Monstania has a somewhat unusual gameplay within the frames of Japanese RPGs. You don't explore the world in the game: it is entirely linear and takes you to the next destination by itself (only at a few points you can choose where to go next by selecting an appropriate answer). Once within the location, you cannot leave it until you complete all your objectives there, which then take you to the next location. The objective is usually a large strategic battle. You navigate your party members on the battle field, attack with melee and long-ranged weapons, and use special technique which require action points. Unlike most other turn-based strategy games, an enemy makes a move immediately after you did the same with one of your characters, without waiting for the "enemy turn". The RPG element is not very significant: your characters level up automatically after each battle. There are also some puzzles to solve in certain locations.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Madden NFL 97</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1996-10-01</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Tiburon Entertainment, High Score Entertainment</td><td>Sports</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Kids to Adults</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">With the versions for PC and 32-bit consoles having moved into the realm of real 3D graphics, Madden NFL 97 on Super Nintendo retains the classic view of the series, updating it with different features and options compared to the Genesis release.The game features the 30 regular NFL teams of the 1996 season and the 1996 All-Madden team.

The game also includes a personality mechanic that effects how party members develop their attributes. Additionally, the game also has the five minigame boardgame tracks known as Pachisi (later known in the series as Treasures n' Trapdoors) added to it.While the Super Famicom version had the above changes, the later released Game Boy Color remake has a few more additions. One addition is another bonus dungeon called the Ice Cave. This dungeon ties in with the other addition which are Monster Medals. Defeated monsters can now drop Monster Medals.  These medals are needed as they allow the player to explore deeper into the Ice Caves.A remake was also released for mobile platforms. It borrows the appearance and most of the changes (including the bonus dungeon) of the Super Famicom version. However this version lacks the pachisi minigame.

Long time ago, the first deity, the Emperor of Light, created two gods - from the darkness, the Ocean God, and from the glittering moon, the Mountain Goddess - and sent them to build a world out of the chaos. The Ocean God poured rain over the chaos and created seas and oceans; the Mountain Goddess created the Earth. But the Ocean God became evil. He built a huge tower, which connected Earth and Heaven, and thus the world of men and the world of gods became merged, and the path for demons to invade the Earth was open.Somewhere on an island called Mamoshima, there lives a young warrior apprentice called Jin. One day he goes to the nearby village, but when he returns, he finds his house has been burnt down by demons, and his sister kidnapped. Remembering the tale of the Ocean God his sister told him when he was a child, Jin realizes he has to find a way to the tower of the Ocean God in order to free his sister. Together with Wokuu, a cute little creature who was human once and wishes to regain her true form, Jin begins the journey.Bushi Seiry≈´den is a RPG with an unusual combat system. Whenever player-controlled characters encounter a monster, the standard top-down perspective switches to side-scrolling, where the opponents attack each other. The battles are in real-time, but are divided into turns (calculated by the number of moves). Before each battle, a number appears on screen which indicates the maximum number of turns the player is encouraged to finish the battle within. If the player manages to stay below the maximum they receive special energy units called "magatama". Depending on the amount of magatama collected during the game, some scenes will change, and the endings will be different.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Ganpuru: Gunman's Proof</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-01-31</td><td>ASCII Corporation</td><td>Lenar Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The year is 1880.

You can duck to avoid the alien monsters' fire, and perform special attacks with various types of weapons.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Super Bomberman 5</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-02-28</td><td>Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.</td><td>Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Puzzle elements</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The fifth and final Bomberman released for the SNES (so far).

The two kingdoms could have lived in peace, but pride took over king Daruk, he didn't respect the Goddess any more, and as a result his mind became obsessed by the idea of destruction. Daruk attacked Reyfore, and for decades war was embracing the two kingdoms, setting the Earth in flames. After a prolonged battle, king Reynard defeated king Daruk, and a reign of prosperity began once again.But can evil be truly defeated? The hero of the game, a young adventurer, falls down from a cliff while taking a stroll near the ancient Sophia Temple. He is saved by an old man who lives with his daughter Refia in a small country house. But one day, a demonic-looking knight appears, accompanied by monsters, kills the old man, and kidnaps Refia. The old man recognized the knight - it was king Daruk! Now the hero must bring Refia back and defeat Daruk once and for all.The game has a less linear structure than a standard Japanese-style RPG: together with the main story there are many missions, or "scenarios", which are not obligatory to complete, but which occupy a large portion of the game. In the beginning of the game you create a party of four characters, the hero and his three companions. The battles are pre-determined and take place on the same screen as the gameworld itself. Your party and the enemies can move freely around the screen and attack with melee and ranged weapons, and their actions depend on the amount of action points they have. Navigation in town is menu-based.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Solid Runner</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1997-03-28</td><td>ASCII Corporation</td><td>Sting, Inc.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td>Detective / mystery</td><td></td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td>Mecha / giant robot</td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td>Isometric</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In the far future Solid City is overrun by mecha-related crime, and few dare face the underworld mafias and street gangs that threaten the city.

The versus mode is split-screen, each player trying to survive and eliminate more invaders than the opponent.The Game Boy version has both one- and two-player modes using the usual Game Boy tones (black and grey). However, plugging the cart into a Super Game Boy allows playing the game in all four cabinet types of the SNES version.

There are varying modes of play, such as Time Trial, Challenge and Story Mode, but the basic idea of play is the same: you must sandwich Star Blocks between two like Friend Blocks, either horizontally or vertically.  The Friend Blocks and any Star Blocks in-between are then removed from play.  Similar to Tetris, sets of blocks fall into the bin that contain any two of the following types:Star Blocks: The most important block, as all of the game types rely on it. Sandwich these blocks between two Friend Blocks either horizontally or vertically, and they will be cleared.  The more stars you clear, the higher the score.Friend Blocks: These blocks have pictures of Kirby's friends - Rick the Hamster, Kine the Fish, and Coo the Owl (all from Kirby's Dream Land 2) - on them. Match two of each to clear them from the screen.  Any Star Blocks between the two character blocks will also be cleared.Bomb Blocks: Sandwich a Bomb Block in between two Friend Blocks, and the bomb will explode, removing all blocks in the same row. Hard Blocks: You have to clear these blocks twice to clear them from the screen. Clear them once and they transform into an ordinary Star Block, and then can be removed in the normal way.The game also features a 'chain' system that rewards you for clearing blocks which then clear other blocks.  If you clear two or more blocks in this manner, then you'll be rewarded with Kirby raining down that amount of Stars, which can fill in gaps, which in turn could complete a row and allow it to chain even further.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Famicom Tantei Club Part II: Ushiro ni Tatsu Sh≈çjo</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1998-04-01</td><td>Nintendo Co., Ltd.</td><td>Nintendo R&D1</td><td>Adventure</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td>Detective / mystery</td><td>Puzzle elements</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">As a young detective (whom you name yourself), you work as an assistant for the famous investigator Utsugi.

Hakku makes its way through levels by changing the position of blocks ‚Äî that will be done by swallowing them to release them on an other place then ‚Äî and sucking potions ‚Äî that are to be injected to blocks by the beak, endowing them with new properties consequential to the colour of the fluid ‚Äî from jars. 
A level is cleared when the rainbow shards in it are collected. Neither a time limit nor enemy characters are there impeding Hakkun's way. Equally distinctive is the score system: a set number of points is given at the beginning of each level, and a decrease happens with any move made, thus rewarding the player for completing levels with as little moves as possible.Before reaching the format of a common Super Famicom cartridge, the game was released for
and downloadable by the console's add-on Satellaview in four versions. Given data size limitations, only one of the four of those, released for use with the Nintendo Power cartridge, could include all the levels designed by game creators: that is the one released as a Super Famicom standard cartridge later, and on Wii's Virtual console eventually.

However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 'flash' mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of complete rows which are already in place.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Picross NP Vol. 3</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">1999-08-01</td><td>Nintendo Co., Ltd.</td><td>Jupiter Corp.</td><td>Puzzle</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Point and select</td><td></td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Picross NP Vol. 3 is the third out of the 8 Picross NP games which were released bi-monthly for the Nintendo Power Cassette in Japan, starting in 1999.The games are basic picross games where the player is tasked with using numbers on a grid to figure out which squares to fill out and which to leave blank to, in the end, reveal a hidden picture.

Like the original title the player controls a space ship using a top-down view and moved around with bursts of thrust. The screen also scrolls endlessly in all directions as the ship always remain in the middle of the screen. The ship has an unlimited amount of bullets and can shoot in all directions. There are both asteroids and enemies to defeat. A radar in the top left corner of the screen shows what is incoming. The ship has a life meter and can take a few hits.Unlike the original game there is an open world progression where different sectors can be tackled in any order by selecting them on a world map. There are also some settings that can be defined before entering a level: six types of firing patterns, two types of bombs and three types of shields.

It was first created as a SNES homebrew game for the 2012 Neo Coding Compo which it won. Initially released as a ROM, it was later made available on a cartridge as well.The game builds on the concept of Soko-Ban puzzles. It consists of fixed-screen levels where objects need to be moved to reach the exit. The SNES version contains 33 levels and the ColecoVision 30. There is very little room to manoeuvre and usually only a single way to solve the puzzle. Usually there are two, three or more rows that contain objects. When there is room to do so, an object can be moved left or right, which causes the entire row to move. This is different from Soko-Ban where only a single block is moved. A combination of these moves is required to move vertically between the open spaces that are created to make way to the right and reach the exit.Notable elements for this remake include an entirely new graphic style with pixel art and a password system. Only the left and right keys are used to move the character. A button can be used to reset the level, but this costs a life as this version also introduces a lives system. Three lives are provided at the start of the game.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">RockFall</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2013</td><td>Piko Interactive LLC</td><td>Playsoft.co</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td>Real-time</td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">RockFall is a Boulder Dash variant, originally made in the 90s as a homebrew ROM and in 2013 released on a cartridge for the first time. The game contains six levels with the standard gameplay of digging to collect crystals and avoiding falling boulders. The player's character is a futuristic, mechanical creature/robot. The difficulty level gradually increases and levels have a time limit. Five lives are available. The game uses the console's Mode 7 feature to zoom in when a crystal is collected. The same function is also used to rotate the level when it is completed and sometimes it is used during the game as well, causing the rocks to fall in the opposite direction.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Uwol: Quest for Money</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2013</td><td>Ubhres Productions</td><td>Mojon Twins, The</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Platform</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Uwol: Quest for Money is a 2D fixed-screen platform game about the character Uwol. It is set in the manor Storm Palace owned by an eccentric millionaire where the rooms are arranged like a pyramid. Each room represents a single-screen platform level with coins and enemies. By moving through any of the four sides of the screen the character appears on the other side. When all coins are collected two exits appears and Uwol can choose a new level in the pyramid with some freedom for the path to follow based on the chosen exit. To win the game a total of 255 coins has to be collected. If the bottom of the pyramid is reached without the required amount the game restarts and a different path can be chosen, avoiding the empty rooms, to collect additional coins.Levels have three types of enemies: Franky, Vampy and Wolfy. Enemies cannot be attacked, they can only be avoided. There is only a small amount of time to clear a room. When time runs out Fanty is summoned who can freely move around the screen and chases Uwol until the character is dead or all coins are collected and the exit is reached after all. Uwol starts with three lives but a single hit is not deadly right away. When hit once, Uwol loses his clothes and a second hit will kill them. By picking up a T-shirt the protection is regained.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Super 4 in 1 Multicart</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2013-12-14</td><td>Piko Interactive LLC</td><td></td><td>Compilation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Super 4 in 1 Multicart is a collection of four homebrew games.

The game was developed with unlicensed tools made by the game programmers. Unfortunately the game failed to acquire a publisher and was never released. 

Luckily we found the original programmer, composer, and artist and we acquired the source code at about 50% of the game. We worked on the game for over a year to finally complete it. 

This are the new features and updates done to the game: 

‚Ä¢Over 100 Bugs and Crashing bugs fixed! 
‚Ä¢Added a whole new world and levels (Volcano) 
‚Ä¢Added Menu, cut-scenes and ending. 
‚Ä¢Implemented password system 
‚Ä¢Designed, developed and implemented boss fights (4) according to the original game story. 
‚Ä¢Organized the game to be able to play with continuity. 
‚Ä¢Over 40 levels and 10 hours of gameplay! 

This game is a puzzle adventure platformer in which you got to help Dorke (and Ymp) to do some errands for your evil Master Wizard in exchange of training you and teaching you his magic spells.

Players take on the role of then-President of the United States Bill Clinton's pet cat Socks on a journey of great political importance. Robbers break into the White House and succeed in stealing a portable nuclear missile... and Socks. Players, as Socks, need to break themselves out while also recovering the nuclear missile to save the world.Players control Socks from a side-scrolling perspective in a typical 2D platformer. Just like most other games in the genre, players can run and jump their way to victory. Being a cat, Socks can also use his claws - this is his main means of protection, with most enemies able to be taken down by a few strategic claw swipes. Players can also pick up a few other items to help them out, such as blocks of cheese that can be thrown to distract mouse enemies. A few levels feature real-world political themes, like the final level set in the White House's famous rose garden, but most feature generic platforming themes like warehouses or sewers. The political theme also shows up in a few bosses which are caricatures of real-world political figures.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">16-Bit Collection: Athena Vol. 1</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2018-02-28</td><td>Retro-Bit</td><td></td><td>Compilation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This release contains the following games in a single cartridge:

Artemiza is a goddess and the daughter of Zeus. She is also the successor to his throne on Mount Olympus. She is very vain and Fiora, the goddess of strife and magic, turns her into the gorgon Medusa. She also makes the other gods believe Artemiza has disappeared. Fiora frees the Titans and takes over the throne. Now Medusa is the only one who can stop her.The game consists of five worlds with multiple levels and a world ends with a boss fight. Each world is tied to one of the Titans: Ariadne (water), Coeus (wind), Ermolai (earth), Fiora (magic and discord) and Thia (fire). A level consists of a single, fixed screen that is completed once Medusa has collected all yellow stars. She has two lives at the start and there are enemies roaming. She can petrify enemies with her gaze and then push them into the water to create bridges. She can also create stone blocks that serve as obstacles.Some enemies have attacks and they respawn from pots. Later levels introduce keys, chests, rotatable arrow tiles that change the movement direction of pushed enemies, and additional lives that can be picked up. The game keeps track of the score and has a timer counting down. If the game is completed quickly enough a sixth and final world is unlocked with a new ending to the story. The game has achievements and an Olympian mode with permadeath.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">R-Type III &amp; Super R-Type (Collector's Edition)</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2018-08-31</td><td>Retro-Bit</td><td></td><td>Special edition</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The R-Type III & Super R-Type (Collector's Edition) is a limited edition published and distributed by Retro-Bit, compatible with all classic SNES consoles and Retro-Bit consoles:

It was created to raise awareness about "crunch time" in game development, a practice in some companies when employees are expected to put in a large amount of (unpaid) overtime hours to get the game done in a proposed time. Devolver Digital donated 100% of their profits from sales to Take This, an organization that raises awareness and aims to combat mental health issues.At the start of the game Fork Parker feels threatened by the rise of a new publisher, Cash Cow Games. They released Loot Box: The Game where only one in twenty downloads contains the actual game and they bought their own e-sports team. Parker decides it is time to catch up with them through crunch time. The player controls Parker in the office with mechanics typical of time management titles. He needs to bring employees caffeine to keep them awake, serve hamburgers at their desks, whip them into working, literally, using a bat, or resuscitate them using a dose of electricity when they pass out. The game takes place on a single, fixed screen and most actions are tied to moving to one of the four stations near the top of the screen, for instance to get coffee. An icon of an employee's head shows the current mood / status and Parker needs to move quickly to the correct station to remedy it. There is also a pink pet pig Pork running around and it needs to be avoided. When Parker comes in contact with it, he shakes it for a long time and B needs to be tapped repeatedly to make him let go.Levels last only five minutes and then the developers' game needs to be done, with progress shown through a bar near the top of the screen. The first level starts with four developers, but the number of people increases with every new stage. Between levels, upgrades can be bought using money. Upgrades affect the stations, but also Parker himself. For instance increasing his movement speed, reducing the time he pets Pork, healing all negative status effects or earning 30 seconds of unpaid overtime. The latter are either single-use items or only last a single day, while the station upgrades are permanent.Coins constantly appear between the desks and Parker needs to collect these to purchase the upgrades. There are also a large number of additional mini-games to play. These are tied to the development, such as completing a mini-game to fix the internet that has gone out so all development is halted. In another mini-game an employee has ordered food delivery through a drone, but lunch breaks are not permitted so Parker needs to intercept and catch the food in a sequence with a side view, throwing items back until the drone crashes.The game was released on a cartridge, with a box and a full colour manual. The initial run was 1,000 copies.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">TinHead</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2019-04-01</td><td>Piko Interactive LLC</td><td>MicroProse Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">On the edge of the universe, the evil intergalactic goblin Grim Squidge has captured and imprisoned all the stars.

Tinhead, guardian of the edge of the universe, hears the cries for help and hurries to the rescue.TinHead is a platform game. Some exploration is required to find the exit or gather extra health or points. Attacking enemies is done by shooting them with small metal orbs that come out of TinHead's head. He can shoot them in three different directions: diagonal upward, straight, or just let them jump out and bounce over the ground. The direction is chosen by using a specific button.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Chip's Challenge</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2021-11-01</td><td>The Retro Room</td><td>Epyx, Inc.</td><td>Puzzle</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>SNES</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Nerdy Chip desperately wants to join the "Bit Busters" computer club, led by Melinda the Mental Marvel.
