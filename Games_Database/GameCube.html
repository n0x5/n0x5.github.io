The courses are largely set inside cities crowded with general traffic and pedestrians (which can't be run over, they dive away). The main goal is to bring as many customers as possible to their destination in time. Available customers are marked through circles and the color represents the distance and the fare they offer. Green means long rides with plenty of money, and red ones are very short. In the main Arcade mode, there is a timer that quickly runs down. It can be replenished by picking up customers. While driving reckless maneuvers are encouraged. Players can disregard all traffic rules and customers give extra tips for speedy and dangerous driving, but these can only be cashed when the customer arrives at his destination in time. By the same token, the reward at the end of a ride is based on the amount of time left, as each customer also has a personal timer. The city is filled with slopes and jumps, and the game uses a very loose driving model. No damage can be done to the car, so driving as fast as possible is encouraged. While driving players can toy with the gears to perform two special tricks: a crazy drift and a crazy boost to speed up more quickly.Next to the Arcade mode, there is an Original mode and Crazy Box where specific goals need to be met on closed-down courses. In the regular modes, it is possible to disregard the usual timer and play for a fixed amount of minutes. At the end of the race, the player is rewarded with a license, either D, C, B, or A, with S for outstanding performance. Next to the interactive courses from the arcade version, there is a new course for home consoles. There are four cabs and drivers to choose from. The cars have different statistics and the drivers' different attitudes while racing. The game has a soundtrack featuring The Offspring and Bad Religion (not for the Xbox 360 version).</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2001-11-18</td><td>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Z-Axis, Ltd.</td><td>Sports</td><td>Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Tricks / stunts</td><td></td><td>Bike / Bicycling</td><td>Sylvain Martel</td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Dave Mirra returns along with 14 pro riders including Ryan Nyquist, Mike Laird, and Collin Mackay. 8 levels are on offer, with a total of 1,500 tricks to master.

Puzzled, Luigi enters the mansion, only to encounter ghosts.  He meets up with a scientist, Professor E. Gadd, who explains the situation and hands over the Poltergust 3000.  Luigi must now make his way through the mansion's many rooms, sucking up as many ghosts as he can.As you explore, you must solve mysteries, collect cash/gems/jewels/coins, and encounter boss characters.  Luigi's vacuum has the ability to suck up ghosts that have inhabited this strange mansion.  However, the ghosts will not give up so easily.  You must struggle with them and pull them back to catch your prey with your trusty vacuum.

It incorporates several modes of play, a variety of racers, customization options, and tracks. Players can race in four tournament cup series, compete in time attack mode against the best track times, compete for points in stunt mode, and simply take in the eye-poppingly beautiful graphics in Free Roam mode. Multiplay is supported in Stunt and Race modes. There are a total of eight racers to choose from, each with a different balance in engine and handling. Customization is limited, but players can change the color of their racer, optimize the engine for either acceleration or speed, and optimize handling to be either tight or loose. However, settings have little effect on the racer's actual performance.
There are eight different courses, however, there are a total of 19 racing tracks laid out across these courses, plus one stunt track for each course.  Also, there are five different weathers, consisting of Sunny, Partially Sunny, Light Rain, Rain, and Stormy. These weathers can have dramatic effects on tracks, making a track raced in Sunny weather totally different when raced in Stormy weather conditions.
The AI is fairly well balanced, but will cheat to stay with a player. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">SSX Tricky</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2001-11-27</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Electronic Arts Canada</td><td>Sports</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Tricks / stunts</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td>Malcolm Andrieshyn</td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">SSX Tricky is EA's follow up to SSX. Tricky features far more storytelling than the original through the use of personality attributes. Rivalries develop between characters with opposing attributes, causing them to act more aggressively towards each other during races. The übertrick system adds a whole new layer to the game. These tricks are much tougher to pull off, but give you a nice boost. Performing six übertricks in a row results in a super übertrick, which rewards you with a bigger boost and causes Run DMC's "It's Tricky" to play. Seven tracks return from the original accompanied by brand-new Garibaldi and Alaska tracks. The returning tracks contain up to four times as many shortcuts and hidden lines. Six of the eight riders from the original return (Jurgen and Hiro suffered off-season injuries) and are joined by six new ones.

Six teams are competing to win a racing championship, the player taking control of any of the two riders available in each team. The game retains the action elements of the previous titles: as before, opponents will try to sabotage the race, and the player-controlled character is able to answer them with his own arsenal of weapons.Unlike the previous installments, weapons cannot be picked up on the road: the player has to purchase them with the money earned after a successful race. All weapons now deplete the player's weapon bar with each shot. Another change is the absence of the "nitro" boosts utilized in the previous entries; they have been replaced with a turbo system, where using the boost drains energy from the player character's shields.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Super Smash Bros.: Melee</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2001-12-02</td><td>Nintendo of America Inc.</td><td>HAL Laboratory, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Fighting</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The sequel to HAL Laboratory's Super Smash Bros., which pitted Nintendo characters against each other, ups the ante by including more levels, more characters, and more game modes.The game is a Nintendo fighting game with different rules to it.

Although there are similarities between characters from the two games, each character looks and plays differently. In addition, there are eight alternative-modes for these characters to unlock, plus dozens of secret characters to obtain. With a multi-tap, up to four players can play, with rules governing how much they can hurt each other. Unlike the original Gauntlets, the levels you'll face take place in various terrain from forests to mountains to volcanic plains. Many of the monsters are familiar to old fans of the series, but there is some new blood among the ranks of evil, including some rather large foes. Unlike the early Gauntlet arcade games, the camera angle varies from location to location, from bird's eye to nearly ground level. The lands, creatures, and heroes are all rendered in 3D. While the graphics have been upgraded, the gameplay is very similar. You basically run around levels, hacking at what seems like unlimited armies of monsters, searching for gold, keys, and health-giving food...as well as a way out of the level. Bosses and other scripted events slow down the repetitious nature of the originals.While levels can be gained and characters saved, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy is an action game with some RPG trappings and should not be confused with the more true types from that genre.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002</td><td>THQ Inc.</td><td>BigSky Interactive, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Back of Case - GameCube (US) (from Ad Blurbs)BLAST OFF!

A timing gauge must be stopped at the maximum point for the best results.The batting interface reuses the pitch type selector, this time for predicting the pitch that is thrown. A batting cursor must be moved to meet the incoming ball to hit it. If the correct pitch was predicted, the cursor is larger and makes hitting easier. Bunts, as well as normal, power, and contact swings, are possible.During fielding, an icon indicates the ball's height and position, and the A button can be pressed to make a super play: diving or sliding after the ball. Before the pitch is made, runners can be made to increase their lead for an attempted steal.

Donald Duck wants to rescue her, and his friend Gyro Gearloose's latest invention, a teleporter, can help. Unfortunately, it can't reach Daisy directly due to a lack of power. To increase the energy, Donald must place weather vanes that catch gamma rays at the world's highest summits: the peak of Duckie Mountain, the Beagle Tower in Duckburg, and the flying mansion of Magica De Spell. Only then can the teleporter reach Merlock's temple so Donald can free Daisy.Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers on the PlayStation 2 and GameCube follows the same story, general gameplay style and level themes as the versions on other platforms, but features unique level designs, enemies and gameplay mechanics.The game is a platformer employing 3D graphics, offering three different styles of level in a manner similar to games in the Crash Bandicoot series: the camera is either placed behind Donald as he runs forward, at his side (emulating classical side-scrolling platform gameplay) or in front of him in levels where he is chased by a giant hand and must run towards the screen.Each level must be completed within a time limit. There are many holes and gorges Donald must jump over, traps to avoid, as well as enemies he can dispatch by hitting or jumping on top of them. Picking up 100 golden gears gains Donald an extra life while collecting five within a second or less spells out one letter of the word SPECIAL. Once the word is completed and the level finished, Donald's nephews will teach him a special move. These moves make him invincible for a short time and result in the gears being worth more when picked up. To activate a move, Donald must jump on three enemies in a row without touching the ground, then pressing the activation button to begin entering a unique button combination within three seconds.When Donald is hit by an enemy or hurt by a trap, he gets in a grumpy mood (indicated by his trademark quacking) and the next hit means the loss of a life. Picking up a milkshake will restore his good mood and health, however. Should he find a glass of orange juice, he becomes Hyper Donald for a short time, allowing him to run over enemies and crash through walls to find hidden areas. Stashed away there (but also sometimes in plain sight) are golden threads. Picking up all three per level unlocks bonus costumes that Donald can change into in Gyro's lab.Each of the four worlds features three or four levels, plus a training stage and a boss fight. The boss fights follow the classic template of each boss repeating an attack pattern that must be avoided, as well as a single weakness that can be exploited to finish them off.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Driven</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-03-26</td><td>BAM!

Only a small part of each character's move set can be accessed this way, however, and if the player does not select EO then the game will play the same as the arcade and previous releases.Playable characters come from the following games:

Selectable characters vary in speed and throwing power.Goals vary between levels and include scoring more points than the opponents, being the last monster standing, hitting a number of targets, or holding on to a special ball the longest. Balls spawn on the ground and must be picked up and thrown at opponents or targets to score points, knock off one of their lives or free a held ball. To avoid being hit, balls can be blocked or dodged. Various special balls with unique properties exist. These include stun balls that knock out opponents temporarily, bubble balls that trap them in a soap bubble, yo-yo balls that come back to the thrower, pet balls that follow their owners around, and many more.Multiplayer modes include Buddy, which is a two-player co-op mode, Team, which allows two-versus-two matchups, and Party, which is free-for-all four a maximum of four players.

The object of the main modes is to build a tower tall enough to reach a balloon at the top of the playfield before the opponent does. If the player tries to take a short cut and not build complete floors, the structure will start crumbling and the water will come up faster. There are plenty of obstacles, both from the game and from competing opponents. Falling meteors can knock the player down into the water, while bombs thrown by the opponent will destroy parts of the player's structure. The main modes include Over Easy and Hard Boiled, the difference being that in the latter a different difficulty can be chosen.There are four extra modes: Survival, Solo, Time Trial, and Bomb. In Survival the player must survive as many rounds as possible, while the goal in Solo is to increase the overall score by completing rows and performing combos; Time Trial challenges the player to continually beat his or her own best time; finally, in Bomb, whoever destroys the opponent's tower first wins.Compared to the GBA version, the console versions have improved graphics and sound, cutscenes at the beginning of each level, a play area that is wider by one block, two additional modes (8-player Tournament and Custom, where the rules can be customized by activating different options), but lacks the Time Trial mode.

The warp room splits levels into their respective elements, with the boss of each section being a battle against Crunch influenced by the Elemental mask of said section.

During the course of the game the player can find magical runes which give him additional magical abilities and power-ups, e.g. health and mana refreshments or temporary and permanent improvements to the attacking and defending statistics. In fact some of these runes have to be earned by completing the story mode multiple times - the player can use the same character for his and gets to keep his abilities and statistics.

Flatland tricks are another new addition. Also, there is the ability to tweak almost any stunt.Single Player Modes:Session - Take some extra time to practice your tricks and routines in 2, 5, or 10 minute sessions on any of the levels that are unlocked. Scores can be saved to be put into the Hall of Fame.Free Ride - Like Session, you can use this mode to practice your skills but with unlimited time. Since any score you get for a trick is replaced by the points of the next trick, no scores can be saved.Road Trip - This is where you take the trip with the guys to go around and compete around the country.

If the person that is it bails then the other person will become it.H.O.R.S.E. - Just like the old game of HORSE for basketball. In this case you need to perform a higher scoring run to beat them for the letter. The one with the lower score with be given a letter. The first person to spell HORSE is the loser.Treasure Hunt - Race against each other to find the Golden Condor. Getting the Condor is the only way to score points.Half Pipe Hell - Up to 8 players can play HotSeat style. You must take turns tricking your way up a mountain of terraced half pipes. The only way to score is to climb to the top by transferring pipe to pipe.Push - This is like Trick Attack, but as you score more and more points your opponent's screen will get smaller and smaller. The loser is the one that gets pushed all the way off the screen.The Pros in the game include Mat Hoffman, Joe Kowalski, Rick Thorne, Mike Escamilla, Simon Tabron, Kevin Robinson, Cory Nastazio, Ruben Alcantara, Seth Kimbrough, and Nate Wessel.The locations you get to go to are Oklahoma City, Chicago, Las Vegas, New Orleans, Boston, Los Angeles, Portland, and Hawaii.To enhance the game, there is also a park editor so that you can make your own dream areas to ride in.Exclusive to the XBox version, you get to be able to ride in London, UK and have an extra rider - Chad Kagy.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">NBA 2K3</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-10-08</td><td>SEGA of America, Inc.</td><td>Visual Concepts Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Sports</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td>Released</td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Sega Sports has added a new season of their basketball franchise.

It is these things that the Brimstone Society hunts, and their newest agent for the cause is the half-vampire codenamed BloodRayne. Her mission will take her from clearing out the walking dead and man-sized insects in the swamps of Louisiana to hunting down members of the secretive Gegengheist Gruppe branch of the Nazi military around the world, as well as the monsters they unwittingly awakened.Rayne's primary weapons against both monsters and men are the blades attached to her arms, and as the game progresses she will gain additional attacks to string together. Rayne can also hold many weapons, such as pistols, shotguns, and submachine guns, at once, but she is not overly attached to them and will discard any weapon that runs dry. Her enhanced vampiric strength even allows her to rip up mounted gun emplacements and fire them from the hip. Another vampiric strength is her ability to drain the blood out of any human she can grab in order to restore her health. By killing enemies Rayne's rage meter will fill, eventually allowing her to enter Blood Rage, slowing the world around her and gaining new combo attacks that can dismember or totally cut in half weaker opponents. Rayne's ability to perceive the world will grow as the game progresses as well, allowing her to see living things through walls, zoom in on distant targets, and speed up her perception that everything, herself included, appears to slow down.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">X-Men: Next Dimension</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-10-15</td><td>Activision Publishing, Inc.</td><td>Paradox Development</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Fighting</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">A group of humanoids known as the Sentinels plan to to rid the world of mutants.

The game features an extensive combo system, including normal chains, air juggles, and air launchers. Beside the basic blocking system, characters have various counter-attacks available, specific to the type of attack the player is countering. In addition to standard attacks, the player can execute super attacks by pressing two punch or kick buttons simultaneously. These include blasts or beams, some of which can stun an opponent, as well as physical attacks that have special effects. There are several different types of super attacks, each having four different levels of power.The stages are rendered in 3D; unlike in most fighting games, many stages consist of multiple screens. The player can choose to move between these screens; kicking the opponent out of the current screen also leads to a location change. Most of the versions include the following modes:
Story Mode - the player follows a scripted mode; only several of the characters are available to control.
 Arcade Mode - a one-player mode where the player fights against the AI in a series of ten matches.
Versus Mode - a two-player game for one-on-one combat.
Survival Mode - a one-player game where the player tests his skills against a never-ending series of enemies, achieving as many victories as possible with only one life bar.

When beginning a level, you have all the time in the world to skate around, perform tricks, get a feel for the level, without the hassel of any goals or time limits.  When you're ready to attempt a goal, simply find a pro skater, talk to him, then receive the goal, similar to Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX.  Goals are similar to the previous games, such as collect SKATE, get a certain amount of points, transfer over this and grind that.  There are new goals, however, such as collecting the word COMBO while doing one big combo.  Miss a trick, and goal fails.  Once all regular goals are accomplished, you can attempt the Pro Goal, which is specific to each skater, and is extremely hard.All the major skaters are here, including Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Rune Gilfberg, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Bam Margera, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, Andrew Reynolds, Geoff Rowley, Elissa Steamer and Jamie Thomas.The levels are been expanded and are huge.  Some of the levels include a college campus, a shipyard, and the infamous prison complex Alcatraz.For multiplayer, all the favorite modes are back, from Graffiti and Trick Attack to Horse and King Of The Hill.  New modes include Capture The Flag and Combo Mambo.  THPS4 also supports System Link play, but not XBox Live.The PlayStation 2 version offers everything from the XBox version, but also has online play, utilizing either your own network adaptor or the official one.  The PS2 version also features a one level demo of Shaun Murray's Pro Wakeboarder, which is not featured on any other version of the game.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Worms Blast</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-10-24</td><td>Ubi Soft Entertainment Software</td><td>Team17 Software Limited</td><td>Action, Puzzle</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Tile matching puzzle</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Worms Blast is a puzzle game similar in concept to Puzzle Bobble, with several important distinctions and gameplay features taken from Worms games. Instead of releasing and matching bubbles, the player has to color blocks on a hexagonal grid. Unlike most Bust-A-Move variants, the player character can move right and left, sailing in a boat. Various weapons, such as bazooka, grenades, dynamite, and others, can be used to fire at the blocks, coloring them on impact. Like in the main, artillery-based Worms games, holding down the fire button increases the power of the weapon, affecting the distance it travels. If the player hits a block that is either the same color as the missile fired, that block and any other same-colored blocks adjacent to it will be destroyed. Differently-colored blocks will not be affected by shooting at them; however, if they are held solely by a group of blocks of the same color, they will fall into the water when that group disappears. Blocks with rainbows on them can count as any color. Unlike Puzzle Bobble, there are no walls in single-player mode. If the player aims the weapon outside of the screen, a heavy object might fall on the player-controlled boat, damaging it.The game's main mode is called "Puzzle mode": the player completes various stages, the goal being different in each (e.g. shooting down certain forms of blocks, avoiding hostile blocks that move around the screen, etc.). Beside this mode, the game features a single-player tournament mode with high scores, as well as a variety of multiplayer modes. The action component is particularly noticeable in this mode, since the walls between the areas will periodically open, allowing players to use this opportunity to shoot at each other's boats.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">TimeSplitters 2</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-10-25</td><td>Eidos Interactive, Inc.</td><td>Free Radical Design Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Shooter</td><td>Cyberpunk / dark sci-fi, Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">TimeSplitters 2, the sequel to Free Radical Design's PlayStation 2 launch title, once again sends players hurtling through time, as they battle the malevolent TimeSplitters in ten unique time periods, from the Wild West to a futuristic space station, and everything in between.The game's story finds Cortez, the series' hero, on a quest to discover the origins of the TimeSplitters, an enigmatic group that travels through time causing trouble for the good people of Earth. Using the paradoxes of time travel to his advantage, the hero can regularly join up with past and future versions of himself, to fight the enemy as a team. A wide selection of historical, modern, and futuristic weapons is available, and environments feature destructible elements.Depending on the difficulty level chosen, players will find themselves with rudimentary objectives to complete or, on the harder settings, new areas and substantially more involved objectives to fulfill. Two players can also play the Story mode cooperatively and simultaneously.Like its predecessor, TimeSplitters 2 features a Challenge mode, which presents the player with a selection of time- and skill-based events. Completing these within the predetermined constraints awards the player with bronze, silver, or gold medals, which in turn aid in unlocking additional game options, levels, and playable characters (of which there are more than 120).The Arcade mode offers League, Custom, and Network sub-modes. League events feature pre-configured maps, game types, and objectives for the player to compete in, while the other Arcade modes make up the bulk of the multiplayer portion of the title. In the Custom mode, up to four players and numerous AI "bots" can compete in 16 different customizable disciplines including Deathmatch, Regeneration, Virus, Thief, Shrink, Monkey Assistant, and Flame Tag -- each offering an altered form of gameplay. Thief, for example, tasks players with collecting tokens left behind by fallen combatants. Here, the tokens determine the winner, not the number of kills.

After the Battle of Geonosis, Anakin and Obi Wan are sent to patrol a dead part of Republic sector, until a massive Confederate fleet ambushes the strategically useless planet of Rhen Var.  After this, Anakin, Obi Wan soon discover that there may be something darker behind the invasion of Rhen Var.  They find out about the Dark Reaper, an evil and powerful Sith device that could harvest the power of the living and use it as a concentrated weapon.  Now it is up to the Republic to prevent this weapon from ever activating and destroying the galaxy!The Clone Wars has you deep inside the battles of the Old Republic through 16 missions, piloting a range of vehicles including speeder bikes, Republic Gunships and fighter tanks as well as the weapon of the Jedi, your lightsabre, for close combat.  Whereas the Rogue Squadron series concentrated on aerial battles, The Clone Wars contains almost all ground battles.  You must fight as Anakin Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Mace Windu, and others throughout the game to prevent the Confederacy from gaining a deadly weapon.  Multiplayer options are also included for up to four players with game types including deathmatch, conquest, and a co-op ground and vehicle survival mode.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Phantasy Star Online: Episode I &amp; II</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-10-29</td><td>SEGA Corporation</td><td>Sonic Team</td><td>Action, Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The epic Phantasy Star Online gets revamped for the Nintendo GameCube.

The game has a bad attitude chock full of sexual themes and language that puts Happy Gilmore to shame.Outlaw Golf pits you as one of ten over-the-top golfing personalities (paired with equally over-the-top caddies) to compete in over 30 different tour events from where you attempt to unlock new characters, better clubs and balls as well as improving your golfer's skills along the way with 12 different mini-games.

Fighting across Nosgoth, his goal is to make his way to the great city of Meridian and take control of this stronghold. However, upon reaching the gates of the city, the army is challenged by the Serafan Order, an organized force of vampire hunters and its leader, the magical Serafan lord. Kain engages the Serafan lord in single combat, is struck down and defeated. Kain's sword, the Soul Reaver, is claimed by his enemy. Unconscious for 200 years, Kain awakes under the care of the vampire Umah to a world he barely recognizes. Following the defeat of Kain's army, the vampires have been hunted down by the Serafan and only a few remain. The city of Meridian is ruled under martial law by the Serafan Order, which is very oppressive towards its citizens. Strange glyph magic is used to power machines and fuel industry and at the same time is deadly to vampires and used as wards throughout the city. Kain swears revenge on the one who defeated him and seeks to reclaim his place as the ruler of the vampires.The Legacy of Kain Series: Blood Omen 2 is a third person action game with adventure elements, more similar in perspective to Soul Reaver than the first Blood Omen game. The player views the environment from behind Kain's shoulder, moving him in different directions, attacking, jumping, using dark gifts, and grabbing on to ledges. Kain's life energy steadily depletes and must be replenished constantly by drinking blood. Blood is found by consuming any living creature nearby, often requiring defeating an enemy through combat first. As Kain consumes blood, his meter is filled up. Once full, Kain gains additional health. Kain also learns new dark gifts throughout the game by defeating boss creatures. Some gifts include: the ability to blend into mist, fire projectiles, use projectile telekinesis or make a great horizontal leap. Many of these abilities can be used to perform stealth kills which will instantly defeat a foe. Kain will fight using his bare hands or by picking up daggers, swords, axes, and other weapons. These weapons all attack differently, eventually breaking, and may also be thrown at enemies from afar.The Serafan Order uses glyph magic, partially because it is deadly to vampires. Kain will often encounter areas where he is barred from progressing because of glyph barriers and must find a way around them. Additionally, glyphs function similar to electricity in that they power machines and switches. Many of the puzzles featured in Blood Omen 2 involve needing to create a glyph circuit in order to deliver power to a specific point. Glyph energy glows as it travels down its path, allowing the player to see exactly where the energy spark is.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">SpongeBob SquarePants: Revenge of the Flying Dutchman</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-12-17</td><td>THQ Inc.</td><td>BigSky Interactive, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">SpongeBob and his pet snail, Gary were playing fetch one morning, when Gary found an old bottle in SpongeBob´s yard.

Mr. Driller and the rest of the crew set out to explore the unique drill-themed attractions and complete them, to earn a stamp from each one.Mr. Driller: Drill Land is a sequel to Mr. Driller.  The basic goal is like the original - players must dig through from top to bottom, aiming to reach the goal depth in meters.  As they dig, they gradually lose air, so they must also collect air capsules to replenish their air and prevent losing a life.  However, Drill Land has five different attractions, each with its own unique take on the Mr. Driller formula:The Hole of Druaga - An obvious homage to the Namco game The Tower of Druaga, The Hole of Druaga has Anna Hottenmeyer digging through a block filled castle, encountering enemies such as slimes, knights and wizards.  Anna must find and defeat the dragon that is guarding the key to the exit, and then make it to the exit to battle the final boss.
World Drill Tour - The standard Mr. Driller mode of play.  Dig your way through to the set depth, using any character that you like.  Each character has their own strengths and weaknesses.
Star Driller - A spaced themed stage where you play as Susumu.  Dig through the blocks, and make your way to the set depth.  Star blocks are power-ups that can either help (such as a barrier for an extra hit) or hinder (like a black hole that sucks all the blocks away close to you).
Drindy Adventure - This stage stars Taizo from the original Dig Dug, in an Indiana Jones-like setting.  Taizo does not require air in this mode, and his goal is to collect a set amount of gold statues.  In his way are traps like rolling boulders, spikes, and flames.
Horror Night House - A ghost-themed stage featuring Ataru as a ghost hunter.  Your goal is to kill ghosts by first collecting holy water to fill your syringe-like drill, and then wait for ghosts to get close to you, and inject the nearby bricks with holy water to stun them.

The princess was kidnapped by the evil dragon Singe and imprisoned in a medieval castle owned by an even more evil wizard called Mordroc. Now, it's only up to Dirk to use his courage and his quick reflexes to overcome the traps in the castle, if he wants to save the princess and his skin.Dragon's Lair 3D: Return to the Lair can be considered a re-imagining of the 1983 arcade game: gameplay-wise it deviates from it significantly, being a full-fledged action platformer with unrestricted character movement. Dirk has to battle enemies, jump across platforms and hazards, and solve a few puzzles on his way. Health and mana points can be upgraded over the course of the game. Dirk can also use a crossbow to combat enemies and solve some of the puzzles. Collecting Dragon Essences scattered through the castle grants him new powers.The game features the familiar cartoon-like style of the original version (done with cel-shaded technique), as well as many familiar locations and boss enemies.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-12-31</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc., Stormfront Studios</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Hack and slash</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td>Cinematic camera</td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Electronic Arts' first game based on the Lord of the Rings movies is an action game with classic beat'em up-style gameplay. Despite the title, it covers events from both the first and the second film in the trilogy.Players, choosing to control Aragorn, Legolas or Gimli, must battle the evil forces of the Dark Lord Sauron in order to protect the Ring of Power and restore peace to Middle-earth. The player character moves through the levels, fighting hordes of Orcs, Goblins and other creatures with various attack and parrying moves. The more varied the attacks are and the less the player is hit, the more points are awarded for each kill. At the end of each level, kill points are accumulated and can be used to gain new abilities. Most of these are new attack moves, unleashed through various button combinations. Others increase health or upgrade the strength or speed of existing attacks. Each of the three characters has unique upgrades and moves.Several levels feature boss battles with the likes of the Watcher of Moria or Lurtz, leader of the Uruk-hai. Each boss requires a unique strategy to defeat.Most combat scenes from the movies have been turned into levels for the game: from the confrontation with the Ringwraiths at the Weathertop and the battle in the Mines of Moria from the first film to fights with Warg-riders and other enemies on the plains of Rohan from the second film. The game culminates in the defense of Helm's Deep, even though the depiction of the battle in the game differs considerably from that in the film.Between the levels, cutscenes tell the story. These scenes combine actual film footage with footage rendered with the game engine.The game offers lots of bonus content, some of which must be unlocked by completing missions or reaching certain levels with the characters. Featured are interviews with the filmmakers and actors (who also provide voices for the game) as well as various making-of features.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Butt-Ugly Martians: Zoom or Doom!</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003</td><td>Vivendi Universal Games, Inc.</td><td>Runecraft Ltd.</td><td>Action, Racing / Driving</td><td>Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td>Hovercraft</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Butt-Ugly Martians: Zoom or Doom! is a futuristic racing game based on the TV series Butt-Ugly Martians.

On defense, two buttons block and steal, and two switch to the other players. Scoring increases a power meter that when full, enables special moves and super dunks that net more points than usual.

The midwestern town of Raccoon City is in ruins, having been overrun with the undead creating T-virus thanks to the wacky hijinks of William Birkin and Umbrella Inc. The player must guide Jill "master of unlocking" Valentine (one of the two main protagonists of the original Resident Evil) out of the city alive. Along the way, Jill will interact with and receive help from (or be hindered by) three Umbrella mercenaries who are also stranded in Raccoon City. Standing in the way of your group's last escape are a horde of flesh-eating zombified citizens, homicidal mutants, and a relentless killing machine known only as Nemesis who is determined to hunt down and kill the survivors of the original Resident Evil, including Jill.A dramatic improvement over Tyrant/Mr. X/G from the previous games, Nemesis can run (faster than Jill, in fact), use firearms (a rocket launcher), dodge attacks, and even move through doors and from room to room in pursuit of Jill. On top of that he still possesses the nigh indestructibility we've come to know from Umbrella's ultimate bio-weapons. Like its two predecessors Resident Evil 3 is a third-person action-adventure game with polygonal characters on pre-rendered backgrounds with cinematic camera angles, a technique originally pioneered by Alone in the Dark. Although the game uses the same basic engine and gameplay as the previous games, the gameplay is improved by features such as auto-targeting, a 180 degree spin, and a new dodge move that allows Jill to avoid enemy attacks. Another addition is Jill's ability to create different kinds of ammunition by mixing together three different types of gunpowder found throughout the game. The game include a randomization feature, which changes the location of certain key items and ammo. Another noteworthy feature is that at certain points in the game, Jill is faced with two choices for a situation, each will affect later story, and even the game ending. The zombies have also been made more diverse.The number of polygons in the character models has also been increased, along with the possible screen resolution and color depth for the PC version (up to 1600 X 1200 at 32 bits, from a maximum of 640 X 480 at 16 bits for Resident Evil 2). Another addition in the PC version is the ability to skip cutscenes as well as the door loading animation.The PC and Dreamcast versions includes all eight of Jill's possible costumes, as well as the mercenary mini-game Operation Mad Jackal which allows you to play as one of the three Umbrella soldiers. On the Playstation version, these special features must be unlocked by beating the game with a high score.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">The Sum of All Fears</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-01-15</td><td>Ubi Soft Entertainment Software</td><td>Red Storm Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Action, Strategy</td><td>1st-person</td><td>Licensed, Regional differences</td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The Sum of all Fears is a first person shooter game reminiscent of the Rogue Spear series. It's from the same development team and the look and feel is alike, although it's not as tactical as Rogue Spear. The game's story is built around the Tom Clancy book with the same title. You take control of a team of elite fighters trained for hostage rescue and anti-terror operations. Each and every team member is the best of the best. The first mission is to recapture a TV station seized by terrorists who broadcast their demands into the world. They have hostages, too, so you need to ensure that no-one gets hurt. But that's only the beginning of a global campaign against terrorism taking in 11 missions. A training mode and multiple difficulty levels are included.Unlike Rogue Spear, you can't choose team members or equipment, it's all pre-defined, from a range of over 15 guns plus grenades . You can't make your own mission plans either, so it comes down to controlling a team member, shooting every terrorist you see and performing various tasks (disarming security systems etc.). Unlike other shooter games, you can't survive many bullets, two wounds is usually enough to kill you. However, you then can switch to another team member.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Micro Machines</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-01-17</td><td>Infogrames Europe SA</td><td>Infogrames Studios Limited</td><td>Racing / Driving</td><td>Top-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Automobile, Track racing</td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In this 3D remake of the original miniature racing game, players can compete on 24 different race tracks with 48 vehicles including toy cars, motorcycles, boats and more, using one of 8 difference characters.

Joseph’s culture hated the goddess Laharah and called her the “goddess of death.”This sequel takes place twenty years later in the realms of Halassar, Galdyr and Munari City which are across the world. You play Maia, who is the incarnate of the goddess Laharah and the powerful Queen of the realm of Halassar. Unlike Joseph’s kinship, Maia’s people worship Laharah as a benevolent creator. Maia was born with the mark of prophecy, her fate being written in the Book of Prophecy. From the beginning, she has welcomed her destiny and knows that she must fulfill the prophecy. What is unknown to her is the path she must follow to do so.Summoner 2 abandons the combo-based real-time combat of the predecessor and is more action-oriented, with the player directly controlling the physical attacks of the main character. Instead of summoning creatures to fight side-by-side with Maia, she actually becomes the demon when it is summoned. Three characters can be part of Maia’s party at one time and AI scripts can be assigned to each. Different characters are introduced as the story progresses and Maia’s skills improve. It is also possible to choose to adventure in “solo-mode”, leaving the party members behind to go on alone.

So, even if you have already played Ocarina of Time, Master Quest offers a new take on a familiar setting.Also included on the compilation are video previews of various GameCube and GBA games. Included on the North American and European disc:
F-Zero GX
1080° Avalanche
Wario World
The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker
Metroid Prime
The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past/Four Swords

Although not the real 6000 kilometers can be crossed in the game, the rally mode takes the player through 12 tracks all the way from France to Dakar. The tracks lead racers through cities, forests, and the desert. Most of them are simple tracks, but there are desert tracks where the player can drive around freely, finding the checkpoints faster than the opponents. The player can choose from the officially licensed cars, trucks, and bikes from Dakar 2002, but only vehicles of the same type can compete in a race. There is also an arcade racing mode, where all the tracks and vehicles that have been unlocked in rally mode can be selected, as well as a split-screen mode for two players.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">TransWorld Surf</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-03-01</td><td>Infogrames, Inc.</td><td>Angel Studios, Inc.</td><td>Sports</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">A surfing game in the vein of Tony Hawk where you perform tricks to rack up points.

By eating Andre, the Lord of the Dark Lums, Globox has enraged the Hoodlums, who plan to take back their master no matter what the cost to the world around them. It's up to Rayman to save the day and find a cure to rid the Dark Lord from Globox. Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is a 3D third-person platform game. Rayman, the main hero, jumps and punches his way through numerous colorful levels, with Globox (and Andre inside him) tagging along and occasionally commenting on the goings-on. Rayman's main weapon is his fist; he can use it to shoot projectiles at the attacking Hoodlums and other foes, and the projectiles are more powerful when the fist is charged by holding down the "shoot" button. The game is divided into several worlds, each divided into a couple of levels; the game is saved automatically after each level. In between the worlds, the player has to complete a mini-game where he has to surf along light-beams in a psychedelic environment. Rayman can also come across power-ups which temporarily give him a special power: the green power-up allows him to shoot tornadoes, the blue power-up gives him the ability to use a grappling hook, the yellow power-up allows him to fly for a short while, the orange power-up allows him to shoot precisely guided missiles and the red power-up grants him a very powerful fist that can bash doors. These power-ups are always necessary to defeat an enemy or a boss, or to get to the next part of the level. Rayman can find and free the Teensies locked in cages throughout the level; the freed Teensies will express their gratitude by opening up the next part of the map or by summoning some bonuses to collect. Each six Teensies freed increases Rayman's health bar. There are numerous bonuses hidden throughout the levels; completing the levels with lots of score will unlock humorous animations and mini-games. The Game Boy Advance Rayman 3 links to the Gamecube through the link port, allowing you to play exclusive mini-games on both systems, and download new levels to the GBA.The PS3 and Xbox 360 versions are straight ports of the original game with HD textures and a smooth framerate.

New secret teams have been added to the previous bunch, including aliens, minotaurs, and Sub-Zero of Mortal Kombat fame.  The customizable Instant Replay is another nice touch, allowing you to relive the awkward moments once you pause the game.  And, of course, Tim Kitzrow and Jim Shorts return to the commentators' booth, making their signature random comments and incessant arguments.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Piglet's Big Game</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-03-18</td><td>Gotham Games</td><td>Doki Denki SA</td><td>Action, Adventure</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Puzzle elements</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Piglet is Christopher Robin's shy and squeamish friend in the children's Winnie the Pooh stories. Also loosely based on Piglet's Big Movie, this version of Piglet's Big Game has a different story and objectives than the PC/Mac version released separately. Each character is voiced by the original actors from the movie. This is a single player adventure game with action elements.In the Hundred-Acre-Wood, Pooh, Eeyore, Roo, Owl, Rabbit and Tigger are going about their normal activities when Piglet sees a scary Granosorus, which disappears before anyone else can see it. When Piglet tries to warn his friends, they don't believe him. Christopher Robin tells Piglet to overcome his fears, but Piglet thinks that he will never be big and brave enough. As his friends start to fall asleep, Piglet leaves the woods and finds a magical telescope which allows him to jump into the dreams his friends are having during their naps.In each of the 6 dream "levels", Piglet must help his friends with problems and puzzles. For example, help Pooh find honey or Tigger find his stripes. Each dreamworld is also dangerous with menacing Heffalumps and Woozles, among other scary monsters. Piglet must defeat these monsters with a tactic he knows well - making scary faces. Some monsters aren't frightened enough, though, so use cookies (hidden in the scenery) to buy some scarier ones at the Brave Face Factory. Find and use Christopher Robin's balloon which gives Piglet a morale boost and a burst of speed. Depending upon the scenario, three characters can be controlled: Piglet, Tigger and Winnie the Pooh.After the 6 nightmare levels are solved, Piglet will face the real Granosorus from the beginning of the game and become a hero by rescuing his friends.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">WWE Crush Hour</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-03-19</td><td>THQ Inc.</td><td>Pacific Coast Power and Light</td><td>Action, Racing / Driving</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Despite what its title might imply, WWE Crush Hour is not a wrestling game.

The likes of The Rock and the Hardy Boys are represented, each with a varying amount of special attacks, weapons and moves under the hood of their vehicle. Simply dive head long into the battle and be the victor at the end.Game modes range from a simple defeat-the-enemy style to challenges that have the player character holding the championship belt for the longest amount of time without blowing up, or taking out the most opponents in the limited amount of time.

On his tenth birthday, Link encounters a giant bird carrying a girl. Link rescues the girl, but as a result his own sister is taken away by the bird. The unknown girl is a pirate captain named Tetra, who agrees to help Link find and rescue his sister. During the course of their journey the two realize that a powerful, legendary evil is active again, and must find a way to stop him.The Wind Waker is the tenth installment in the Zelda series. Like its predecessors, it is an action game with puzzle-solving and light role-playing elements. Basic gameplay mechanics are similar to those found in Ocarina of Time: Link explored 3D outdoor areas and dungeons, fighting enemies and occasionally solving environmental puzzles. An addition to the combat system is the ability to parry at specific times, which is needed to overcome armored foes. Another new feature is picking up and using some of the weapons wielded by the enemies. Similarly to previous games, Link can use tools such as bow and arrow, boomerang, and bombs.Link needs to sail through the Great Sea in order to travel to other islands. He uses a baton called the Wind Waker to change wind direction by conducting it and producing melodies. The Wind Waker is also used for teleportation and puzzle-solving purposes. Link can use wind currents to glide and access remote areas. Visually, the game utilizes cel-shaded graphics to create a cartoon-like appearance. The characters' bodily proportions and facial features are not realistic, complementing the style. Link's big eyes, in particular, also have a gameplay-related function, giving clues to the player by looking at specific items needed to solve puzzles.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">The Sims</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-03-25</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Edge of Reality, Ltd.</td><td>Simulation</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Life / social simulation, Managerial / business simulation</td><td>Contemporary</td><td></td><td>Multiple units/characters control, Point and select</td><td>Real-time</td><td>Teen</td><td>Isometric</td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Back of Box, PS2 (U.S./Canada) (from Ad Blurbs)GET A LIFE!It's time you moved out of Mom's house and spread your wings as a Sim.

Ten Barbarians, all with their own reasons to hate Zaugg, come forward, each willing to destroy the wizard and prove themselves the hero of prophecy.Barbarian is a 3D vs. fighting game in a fantasy setting, inspired in gameplay largely by the Power Stone series. The game features ten characters who battle it out in fully three-dimensional, multi-level arenas, including castles, sewers, shipwrecks, swamps, and caverns.Training mode includes tutorials for all of the game's moves and a practice session against a live opponent. Versus mode allows players to set up any fight they want, including four-player battles. The game's main single-player mode is Quest mode. Players select one of the ten characters, each of which has their own storyline. The story includes fights against all the other characters in the game and also features mirror matches. In some of the fights, opponents bring some lesser minions with them for support. After a fight is won, players can select which opponent to take on next, allowing for different paths through the story. Also after a fight, players can update their characters, raising their attributes like life, strength, damage dealt or magic regeneration time, and also unlock special abilities like double jumps or a berserker mode.The fighting system is based on two basic buttons, one for weak and quick, one for strong and slow attacks. Stringing button combinations together enables combos, which each character having their own set. Some combos unleash magical attacks, which require the magic bar to be filled. Landing combos successfully enables additional rune attacks. Blocking and counters are also possible. The game's levels feature many objects to pick up that can be used as throwing or melee weapons.

This is the idea behind Burnout 2, which brings new modes and higher speeds compared to the original title. As usual, the aim is to speed around real-life roadways, through the traffic ahead, while avoiding collisions. Burnout is a street racing game focused around speed and crashing.  Unlike many games that focus on closed course driving, you get to drive through cities with real traffic and city infrastructure.  Designers have built city districts and surrounding areas and implemented the racecourses throughout the streets.  As a result, many times certain parts of race-courses interlace with other parts of other races.  As well, instead of encouraging strategic driving and safe driving, Burnout strongly encourages offensive driving.  Driving on the wrong side of the road, barely missing passing traffic, drifting, and jumps all add to your boost "burnout" meter.  Speed boosts and jumps aid your attempt to drive past buses, trucks, and anything else that gets in the way.  The more offensive and dangerous your driving is, the more boost you get!Burnout 2 contains a full campaign and custom car campaign.  While you can unlock regular cars and tracks, later in the campaign you unlock more raceways like reverse tracks and one-way sprints.  You can unlock over 20 cars like a Nascar, a 1920s gangster car, a Japanese muscle, and many customized vehicles with custom paint jobs and upgraded stats.  Along with the same sense of speed and highly detailed crash animations as before, Point of Impact includes new modes of play.  Pursuit mode has you playing the cop as you chase down the speeding motorists, and to win you must crash them out of the race.  Or you can reverse that with a friend.  You can flee from a friend while he attempts to chase you.  Crash mode, as the name suggests, forces you to glide into crowded intersections to get the most cars involved in a pile-up as possible.  The bigger the crash, the better.  Up to 4 players can compete for the best score.Training and 2 player racing modes are also included.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-04-11</td><td>Ubi Soft Entertainment Software</td><td>Ubi Soft Entertainment Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td></td><td>Spy / espionage</td><td>Stealth</td><td>Asia, North America</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Splinter Cell is a third-person action game with a focus on stealth, similar to the Metal Gear Solid series. The player takes on the role of Sam Fisher, an operative for the secret organization NSA Black Operation, part of the U.S. government. The organization deals with very sensitive missions, often taken on by a Third Echelon splinter cell division Fisher is part of.  His missions are so discreet, that if he is captured the government will deny any such existence of that organization.To get around and reach his objectives, Fisher has a variety of moves at his disposal. He can walk, run, crouch, jump, rappel, shimmy, cross horizontal wires, zip using a zip cord, and do a split jump. There are different approaches to taking out enemies. He can use weapons, but the noise might alert guards and that generally makes it more difficult to complete missions. Opponents can be stunned, killed, or subdued. Fisher can for instance jump down from the ceiling and knock an opponent unconscious. Some enemies are needed to activate a door or passcode. Therefore enemies can be taken hostage by holding a gun to their head. They can also be interrogated or be used as human shields.Other features include the ability to peak through a door before going through or use an optic cable camera (a "snake" camera) to peer through the underside, to check what is ahead. As the focus is on stealth, the amount of weapons is rather small. There is an FN F2000 assault rifle that can be fitted with a silencer and other modifications, and there is a suppressed FN Five-Seven pistol. Ammo is limited and additional bullets are scarce. Players are encouraged to avoid danger by sneaking through shadows and hiding behind objects. Fisher has access to a light meter to check how visible he is, and night vision as well as thermal goggles to see in the dark and view warmer temperatures in colour. Other weapons are ring airfoil projectiles, gas grenades and sticky shockers.The Xbox version is the original one, with a closely adapted version for the PC, and separate ports for PS2 and GameCube. The latter have slight changes in levels generally to make it a little easier. Each version also contains some exclusive features. The Xbox and PC versions include three additional downloadable missions (Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Mission-Pack). The PS2 version has an exclusive level, and the GameCube version can be connected with a Game Boy Advance through a link cable to view an overhead map. The PS2 and GameCube versions include additional binocular items, and the latter also has an extra sticky bomb weapon. The PS2 release also has an exclusive 5min pre-rendered intro cinematic with full orchestrated score, showing how the two agents you are sent to look for at the beginning of the game were captured.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Ikaruga</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-04-14</td><td>Infogrames, Inc.</td><td>Treasure Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Vertical shoot-em-up ported from the Naomi Arcade version. Ikaruga is more or less a sequel to Radiant Silvergun on the Sega Saturn.Based on a two-colors system, the player has to switch between the black & white sides of his ship during gameplay.
The black side is immune to black enemy bullets which it considers as a bonus and dies on impact with white enemy bullets. Your own black bullets damage white enemies twice as much as white bullets. And vice-versa for the white side. Those properties make a balance between protecting yourself well and killing enemies fast. This aspect, combined with specific enemy patterns and a combo system makes Ikaruga an original shoot-em-up with a dose of strategy.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">X2: Wolverine's Revenge</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-04-15</td><td>Activision Publishing, Inc.</td><td>GenePool Software</td><td>Action</td><td>Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Wolverine has just hours to find a cure to a virus and save his life.

Hitman 2: Silent Assassin is a third-person stealth game. As a titular hitman, you have to complete a number of missions all over the world. Each mission generally involves assassinating someone and possibly fulfilling a couple of other objectives. Typically, your target will be protected by numerous guards. While there's a large arsenal of weapons available to you - ranging from stealthy weapons such as a garrote or a silenced pistol, up to machine guns and sniper rifles - your main weapon will be stealth. Agent 47 can sneak around to remain undetected, and he can disguise himself in clothes from killed or stunned guards. The guards aren't completely stupid, however, as they will investigate suspicious noises, and they'll react if they see you waving around a gun. They'll get suspicious if they see you running around, raise alarm upon finding a corpse, and if you hang in a disguise around them too long, they'll eventually realize you're not one of their buddies. Hitman 2: Silent Assassin brings something new to the series: depending on your stealthiness, you are given a rating upon completing a mission. Going trigger-happy on everyone will result in being called a "Mass Murderer", while only the most patient and skilled players will manage to receive the "Silent Assassin" rating, which generally involves stealthily eliminating the target without raising any suspicion. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Sonic Adventure DX (Director's Cut)</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-06-17</td><td>SEGA of America, Inc.</td><td>Sonic Team</td><td>Action</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Metroidvania</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">An updated version of the Sega Dreamcast hit Sonic Adventure, the first appearance of Sonic and the crew in a full 3D action title.Once again Sonic is up against Dr. Eggman, who had teamed up with Chaos for the ultimate opportunity to take over the world.

Certain races in each class have limits on what cars can be entered, forcing you to mix things up a bit and develop different strategies.Quick Race is good if you just want to jump into the game and start. You can use any parts, cars, and tracks you've unlocked so far from the Championship mode.Time Attack is a time trial mode where the object is to get the best time you can with the car and track you choose.Versus is the game's multiplayer mode. Two to four players can battle it out with any unlocked cars and tracks.Drift-Combo is a challenging mode that scores you based on how well you can drift on a selection of three drift courses.

Drome Racers features on- and off-road racing in vehicles that resemble their LEGO counterparts, with some designs being completely new. The game focuses on the Career mode, where the player takes the role of Max Axel, the driver of the newly-formed Team Nitro, one of the six racing teams in Drome, a large elliptic racing arena with many different natural and urban surroundings. All drivers compete in a set of Multi Challenge Races (MCR), which are a series of connected races. At the start of each MCR, a drag race determines the pole position, while in all subsequent races, the position, and delay at which the driver approaches the starting line is determined by the results of the previous race. Hence, whoever wins the last race of an MCR, wins the MCR itself. There are 9 standard tracks available, and each one has A and B variations (up to half of the track can differ), and can be driven in forward or backward directions, resulting in 4 ways to drive on each track. Three MCR categories exist; Novice, Intermediate, and Expert, with the opening MCRs of each category unlocking new tracks. Different times of day and weather conditions are also featured.After a certain number of MCRs, individual drivers will challenge Max to race in all four variations of a track. Finishing in fourth place or better (or just first in challenges) earns upgrade points (which can be used to improve the engine, turbo, aerodynamics, tires, and armour), and finishing certain MCRs or challenges earns build tokens, which can be used to unlock new cars. All cars can be driven with automatic or manual gear changing, except for manual-only drag cars. Scattered on the tracks are health and weapon powerups, as well as accelerator pads. Each car has four measures of health - the less health it has, the slower it gets, and when it loses all the measures in the health meter, some (non-essential) parts can fall off the car. Various weapons add to the arcade nature of the game and help drivers maintain their position or press forward. Joining Max in Team Nitro are Rocket, a retired driver who arranges practice and challenge sessions and gives tips on the game mechanics; Shicane, the team's mechanic who informs Max of the upcoming races and manages the garage (cars, upgrades, and unlocking); and Slot, the analyst who follows Max' statistics and enables saving/loading of the Career mode progress. They assist Max in winning the 2015 Drome championship and dethroning the current champion, Sever from Team Exo Force.In addition to the Career mode, players can choose Arcade mode and the Quick Race mode (which is the same as Arcade, only with randomized settings). These modes only feature tracks that have been unlocked in at least one saved game from the Career mode and can be played by one or two players in local split-screen multiplayer.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius - Jet Fusion</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-09-16</td><td>THQ Inc.</td><td>Krome Studios Pty Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other), Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td>Comedy, Spy / espionage</td><td>Platform, Shooter</td><td>Contemporary, Fantasy, Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td>Bike / Bicycling, Flight / aviation, Mecha / giant robot</td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td>Free-roaming camera</td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius - Jet Fusion is a platforming action game based on the Nickelodeon special of the same name.

Uncle Scrooge invites four of them to his theme park. At the beginning of the game, each character is handed a five-by-five game board, with randomized colors. The goal is to complete rows on the board (how many can be adjusted before a game) by putting items of the appropriate color on the board, with the first player to complete his board being the winner.The characters move on a 3D game board. Movement is not made via dice but the so-called Wheel of Destiny. Players choose which space on the board they want to go to next. More players wishing for the same space increases its chances of being chosen. All characters then move to the selected space together.There are 14 different types of space, including items, events, shops (which use crystals as currency), transportation to another part of the board, and mini-games. The mini-games, of which there are 30 different ones, are the main part of the game. All are played by all four characters together and include racing, shooting, image-matching, counting, pressing displayed button combinations, and many more. The goal is to collect a number of stars, with the player who reaches the number first being the winner. Power notes, which can either be found or bought in shops, can be used to give an advantage during a mini-game.To reach the goal of completing the rows, found or bought items can be placed on the game boards upon winning a mini-game or reaching the appropriate space. Items can be put on other player's boards, too, to help or sabotage their efforts. Special items include ones that re-arrange the board grid or block off rows.Once the set number of rows is completed, the main game ends, but a final challenge round follows, consisting of another mini-game and special awards for the likes of "best item collector" or "best mini-game player". The player who completed the rows first starts with an advantage, but it is also possible for other players to win if they were better in the award categories. Completing the game unlocks collectible character cards, depending on the reached score.Unlocked mini-games can be played on their own in the Mini-Game Mode, while Free Pass mode allows one to navigate around the game board freely and try out any attraction or game.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">NHL 2004</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-09-22</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Electronic Arts Black Box</td><td>Sports</td><td>Behind view, Diagonal-down, Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Managerial / business simulation</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The "best selling pro hockey franchise" is back with the 2004 edition, and it's loaded with more.Like Madden NFL 2004, NHL 2004 has a deep career mode, titled Dynasty Mode.

For the 2004 sports season, Midway introduced a directive to move their sports titles away from over-the-top arcade-style gameplay, and introduce a more sim-like approach to sports. For NHL Hitz Pro, this meant moving away from 3-on-3 hockey to 5-on-5 hockey gameplay to make the game more authentic for the demands of the sim hockey player. While NHL Hitz Pro still maintains many of the arcade-style elements that were a signature feature of the Hitz series such as checks over the boards and hits through glass, the gameplay has been tuned to provide an experience that is accurate to the sport of hockey. That being said, the player has extensive options for tuning the gameplay for either a fast-paced arcade experience, or a slower, more sim-like style of play.As with competing titles, Hitz Pro supports a franchise mode, season and exhibition gameplay and a game tutorial/practice mode. The title also sports a pickup hockey mode with several environments that are reminiscent of playing hockey in outdoor venues.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-09-22</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Electronic Arts Redwood Shores Studio</td><td>Sports</td><td>Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Tiger Woods is back for another round of golf in this edition of the series.

For those unfamiliar with the game, two seven-player teams of flying wizards attempt to score goals with one ball while dodging more flying balls and each other.  For those who are familiar with the game, you will be happy to know that the players, positions, and “strategies” of Quidditch are faithfully recreated.The game starts with a player selecting which of the four Hogwarts school teams he or she wishes to play for.  Following some tutorial events, they are launched into the competition for the Hogwarts Cup against the other three teams.  As the player wins games and completes specific challenges (such as “score 120 points in one game”) they collect Quidditch cards which unlock special combo moves.  Once a player has won the school championship, they can go on to play as one of nine international teams competing for the Quidditch World Cup each with its own style and special combo moves.  After winning the cup once, there are still more cards to be collected by playing and winning as different teams.People familiar with actual sports know that the rules of Quidditch (as described in Rowlings' books) are fundamentally flawed and that the only meaningful part of the game is the 1 on 1 competition between the two seekers trying to catch the golden snitch.  Quidditch World Cup alleviates this problem with the “golden snitch bar”.  As the game progresses, completing action combos and performing special moves adds to a team progress bar.  Eventually, when the snitch appears, the team with better positioning on the bar will start with an advantage in the chase.  Ironically, this system rewards things other than actual scoring so in-game goals still remain mostly meaningless (except on lower difficulty levels where it is very easy to build a 160+ point lead and make the snitch inconsequential).Because it is designed for younger audiences, Quidditch World Cup lacks most of the advanced features you would expect in an EA sports game (league play, team management, etc…).  It also lacks any multiplayer options other than two-player (same machine) exhibition matches</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Rogue Ops</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-10-28</td><td>Kemco U.S.A., Inc.</td><td>Bits Studios Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td>Spy / espionage</td><td>Quick Time Events (QTEs), Stealth</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In Rogue Ops you control Nikki Connors; after your family is killed by terrorists, you are recruited into the covert anti terrorist group Phoenix.

You can hide in the shadows, in crates and vents, hang from the ceiling, and sneak up on guards to kill them before they see you.

Afterwards, you try to impress the pro, and he gives you advice on how to go about becoming a star.  With your friend, Eric, you're now on your way to becoming a legend.THUG takes you to various cities to perform different goals.  You begin in New Jersey, which acts as a sort of training stage, where goals are simple.  Eventually, you'll visit Manhattan, Vancouver, Moscow, Tampa, San Diego and Hawaii.  Most cities are split into different chapters, with each chapter opening new goals.THUG introduces a new system; walking.  You can get off your skateboard to run or walk around the level.  If there's a high tower you want to jump off of, get off your board, climb to the tower (by climbing a ladder or shuffling across a wire), get back on your board, and jump down.  One of the new tricks associated with this is the Acid Drop, which can launch you off an opposing pipe, allowing you to pull off 1080's and up.Also new to THUG is the ability to drive certain vehicles, like a gardener's truck, a sports car, or a leaf blower.

However, Wanda Parks, the Chief of the E.O.D (Elite Operations Division), requires Nick's  assistance in a case that involves attacks on various venues in the Chinatown district. At first Nick is reluctant to help, preferring the vigilante life and focusing on avenging his father's death. However, he eventually agrees to conduct the investigation, on one condition: he must do it his way.True Crime: Streets of LA is a free-roaming driving and action game similar in concept to Grand Theft Auto III. The game's structure is mission-based; most of the missions are dictated by the story and initiate following a cutscene that advances it. Failing a mission still allows the player to continue playing through the chapter and undertake subsequent missions; in some cases this will lead to branching paths and optional missions. However, in order to complete the whole chapter the player must eventually succeed in all the main missions.Nick can hijack any car on the street (usually with little to no repercussions) and freely drive through the 240 square miles of Los Angeles. Nick is capable of firing his weapon when driving; in an open top vehicle, it is possible to aim anywhere. The player can also opt for exploring the city on foot. Nick will be frequently contacted by other police officers and informed about various street crimes. He can then fight perpetrators, arrest them, knock them unconscious, or kill them to deal with these crimes.The gameplay during the missions is separated into third-person shooting, fighting, and (more rarely) stealth sequences. All of these usually take place in relatively small, restricted environments. The shooting sequences involve Nick dealing with waves of enemies that appear in different places. Nick must react quickly, moving, crouching, or diving (with a "bullet time" effect) to avoid enemy attacks. A limited amount of painkillers can be found in such stages.During the fighting sequences, Nick utilizes his martial arts techniques to defeat enemies in hand-to-hand combat. Nick can punch, kick, grapple and throw enemies. The player can execute combos by pressing various combinations of buttons consecutively. It is also possible to pick up primitive melee weapons lying around, or take them from enemies. Both shooting and fighting stages have destructible environments.Stealth missions typically involve Nick traversing a hostile area without attracting the enemies' attention; the mission is failed if an enemy hasn't been dealt with silently, or shortly after he has discovered Nick. The player has the option of killing enemies or knocking them down; the latter awards the protagonist "good cop" points. Conversely, "bad cop" points are given to Nick for killing innocents or surrendered criminals. Depending on Nick's rating in these categories, the storyline branches during later chapters, leading to different endings.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Yu-Gi-Oh!: The Falsebound Kingdom</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-11-04</td><td>Konami Digital Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Konami Computer Entertainment Japan, Inc.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG), Strategy</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Real-time, Turn-based</td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The young boy Yugi Muto, his friend Joey Wheeler, and other characters from the Yu-Gi-Oh! manga are sucked into a virtual game created by a mad scientist named Scott Irvine, who wants revenge against Seto Kaiba, the CEO of Kaiba Corporation, for firing him.

This world is inhabited by, of course, cartoon characters. Filming is done in the toon world and then sent to the real world for editing and production, thus reducing the tedium and cost of animation. However, the animation industry is under heavy pressure from new computer-generated techniques of animating. In an effort to revitalize traditional Cel animation the real-world Studio SPUMCO will be creating a cartoon based on Extreme Skating. And so auditions begin in the Toon World.
The cast of characters are all Cel-Shaded and mostly anthropomorphisms. You will control one of them through eight large sets to try and be selected for the cartoon. You collect points by doing what you would do in any skateboarding game, grinding, jumping, the usual ticks. However,  here there is a twist. Seeing as you are a cartoon you can gain points by being beheaded crushed and other familiar animated antics. Sometimes a level will consist of a battle or a race.
The game also contains a two-player versus mode.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-11-18</td><td>Ubisoft Entertainment SA</td><td>Ubisoft Entertainment Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Platform, Puzzle elements</td><td>Fantasy, Middle East</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The King and the Prince of Persia are besieging the Maharajah's castle to plunder the treasures hidden inside.

At night, Harry must watch out for prefects patrolling the floors of the castle to avoid getting sent back to the common room. There's also broomstick flying in the game, including a Quidditch match against Slytherin.After classes, Hogwarts can be freely explored.

Anyone who comes into contact with it must die. But humans have learned to develop a technology that would help them to protect themselves from the deadly vapor. The light of Crystals shines in small villages and in large towns. But those protective Crystals have to be refilled every year with the purifying Mana Water, otherwise, their energy will extinguish. Every year, villages send four youths to retrieve the Mana Water that is hidden deep in dungeons and dangerous caves. Sounds like the story of the first Final Fantasy? The plot of this first Final Fantasy game for a Nintendo console since Final Fantasy VI goes back to the roots of the series, but the gameplay has changed a lot. Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is an action,  Zelda-style RPG. At the beginning of the game, the player chooses one of the four available character classes: magic-using Yukes, thief-like Selkies, gentle-natured Clavats, and cute little Lilties. The game can be played with the chosen character in single-player mode, or, using the GBA-GC connection link, played with three other people, each controlling their own character.Each character has both armor and a weapon that can be replaced by crafting a new one with the appropriate items in towns. Found in each monster-filled area are artifacts that raise statistic points until the end of the area, and upon completion one artifact can be kept to raise that stat permanently. In a multiplayer game, players will be given secret objectives, and by completing their objective they have a chance at claiming first dibs on artifacts at the end of the area. Spells are also found in combat areas, though they can not be taken out of them. If spells are placed next to each other in the quick select list, or cast near each other in a multiplayer game, they will merge and become a more powerful spell. Finally, in single-player mode a moogle will take care of holding the "bucket" that pushes away the toxic miasma around the party, but in a multiplayer game, one of the players will have to take up this ignoble task.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">007: Everything or Nothing</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-02-17</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Electronic Arts Redwood Shores Studio</td><td>Action</td><td>Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td>Spy / espionage</td><td>Shooter</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">A nanobot has been stolen from the work of a world-renowned scientist, Dr. Katya Nadanova, of the Oxford Department of Microtechnology by a man known only as "the General", who has kidnapped Dr Nadanova as well.

The Xbox version features voice recognition: team orders can be given through a headset.Before each mission, each squad member must be equipped with a primary and secondary weapon plus further equipment. More than two dozen realistic firearms are available, and there are also different types of grenades (hand-thrown or fired through a launcher), charges and mines, as well as a gas mask. Thermal and night vision are always available and don't require special equipment.Despite the action focus, the game still opts for a certain amount of realism: there is no running or jumping, more than a few hits are fatal and there is no way to regain lost health.Besides the single player campaign, there is also the custom mission mode, which allows the player to hunt terrorists on unlocked maps from the campaign.The multiplayer modes include:

Cooperative campaign mode
Cooperative custom mission mode
Sharpshooter mode: a timed deathmatch with respawning, the player with the most kills wins.
Survival mode: no respawns, the last player standing wins.
Team Survival mode: no respawns, the last team standing wins.

Multiplayer features vary between platforms: The GameCube doesn't have the competitive modes, PS2 only supports six players online instead of the Xbox' sixteen, and both coop modes are only available via split screen on PS2 and GameCube.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-06-02</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Electronic Arts UK Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td>Detective / mystery</td><td>Puzzle elements</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Based on the third book and movie of the series, players now take control of Harry, Ron, and Hermione in this 3D adventure as they face the dangers of their third year of Hogwarts, avoiding the soul-stealing Dementors, and trying to solve the mystery of escaped convict Sirius Black.

This sorcerer was known as Vaati, and it seemed that no one could stop him. Eventually an adventurer appeared who was able to defeat Vaati. This adventurer carried with him the four sword which caused him to be split into four beings, and by working together the four beings were able to seal Vaati deep within the earth. But now Vaati has escaped, and the task of defeating him again has fallen to Link!This action adventure game is played from a top down point of view. There are a variety of often maze-like lands to explore (some above ground and others below) as well as a variety of enemies to defeat. Since Link is now in possession of the four sword, there are four Links on the screen. In order to complete the various stages, the four Links will often need to work together in order to solve puzzles and defeat the many enemies. The four links are able to form several different formations, such as a line or square. The formations help the Links perform actions that couldn't be done by one, like moving heavy objects or defeating numerous enemies. At the beginning of each stage, the four sword will be weak in power; to replenish the swords power, force gems must be collected (which can be found hidden in various locations or by defeating enemies). At the end of each stage is a dark magic barrier, and the only way to destroy it is by a four sword which has been completely restored. The game can be played by one to four players, however there will always be four links on the screen. In multi-player games each player will control one of the Links and will need to connect with a Game Boy Advance which is used both to control the game as well is provide each player with their own display when their Link is inside a house or in a cavern.In addition to the adventure mode, a multi-player battle mode is included where four Links fight to see who wins. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Ribbit King</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-06-08</td><td>Bandai America, Inc.</td><td>Jamsworks Co., Ltd.</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Get your clubs and play some Frolf!

Where Lloyd Irving is a student under the tutelage of Professor Raine Sage, who specializes in magic and archaeology. His school friend Colette Brunel has been rumored to be the daughter of an angel. She was born with a sacred stone in her hand, because of this she is the "Chosen of Sylvarant". The Chosen must complete the world regeneration, a quest to unlock magic seals and enter the otherworldly Tower of Salvation, to make the slowly dying world a true paradise. This will mean the end of the Desians, a race of half elves, who now dominate the land through work camps, fear, and force. The characters develop not only through cut-scenes, many of which feature voice acting, but through what the game calls “skits”. These  "skits" however, do not feature voice acting like the in-game cut-scenes. A warning is displayed on the bottom left hand side of the screen when a skit becomes available, it can then be activated by pressing Z. The Skit generally features two or more of the characters interacting. They will react to what is said and depending on the characters and the situation the results can be anywhere from comic to tragic. This system allows one to understand the feelings of each character.Special features of the game include: Ex-Spheres, Strategy and Cooking. Ex-Spheres are special objects which enhance a character's abilities or may even grant new ones. These abilities can affect battle or have an effect outside of battle. Each Ex-Sphere will have a level of 1-4 each with more powerful abilities; up to four Ex-Spheres can be attached to each character. Strategy can be applied to CPU controlled players, for example making spell-casters attack a specific enemy or ordering them to stay behind the front-lines. An alternate way to heal characters is to cook. This is based on the specific character's skill to cook and the ingredients used.Most of the game is spent, like most RPGs, in towns, dungeons, towers, sprawling world maps, and of course combat. Battles in Tales of Symphonia are fought in real-time. Only four members of your party can participate, each with unique fighting styles. As the game progresses, you are not restricted to only using Lloyd, all major characters are playable which allows you to switch your gaming style. Basic physical attacks are carried out with the A button and pushing the control stick in various directions. The B button is used for special physical attacks and casting spells. Often these special attacks can be linked from a basic physical attack to Special Attacks in progressing levels of 1-3. During a battle you run in a straight line and are able to jump over enemies. In Multiplayer up to 3 more players may partake in battles with you.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">NCAA Football 2005</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-07-15</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>EA Tiburon</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other), Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Multiple units/characters control</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">NCAA Football 2005 is the latest in EA's counterpart series to Madden.

This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto your opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.When an opponent sends Nuisance Puyos to your screen you can try to "offset" by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to your opponent. When any player's field becomes so full that they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game.The game features a two-player mode.

It's also possible to create all kinds of competitions. 
The Career mode was also extended, allowing now up to 15 seasons, and giving the player the chance to turn the tide of a simulated match anytime. This mode is a "light" managerial mode, where the player not only plays, but also signs new players and increases the club's abilities in trainers, medical staff, and other club staff).
The main gameplay change was the addition of "First Touch" controls. By performing one of the "trick" moves before the player gets possession of the ball it's possible to do a number of moves, such as touching the ball forward to gain a few yards ahead of the defenders or touch the ball to one side, and roll to the other of a rushing defender, and then pick up up the ball a bit ahead leaving the opponent stranded, and the inclusion of a fake shot move, which allows forwards to sit a goalkeeper before scoring in style or make defenders jump from their positions, opening room for a through pass or a run into the goal. Other aspects of the game, such as the "Off The Ball" controls (allows the control of players that aren't in possession, moving them into an open position) remain unchanged.Another new feature is the FIFA Shop, where the player can trade points earned in many ways, from simple tasks like having a peek at the Jukebox to obtaining 10 victories in a row in Career mode, for several items, such as third jerseys, additional music, more balls and night stadiums.As it became the norm with the series, the game features 18 leagues and 38 national teams (some of these, due to licensing problems feature only generic kits and logos), summing up to around 11,000 real footballers. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Midway Arcade Treasures 2</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-10-12</td><td>Midway Home Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Digital Eclipse Software, Inc.</td><td>Compilation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Midway Arcade Treasures 2 is a compilation that contains the following games:

The player takes the role of TY, a Tasmanian tiger, armed with sharp teeth and boomerangs a-plenty. On TY's quest to defeat the evil Boss Cass and his army of cold-blooded Frilled Lizards, he must assist the colorful residents of Burramudgee Town and the Southern Rivers, who include a tree frog, a lyre bird, a platypus family, some kangaroos and more koalas than you can shake a didgeridoo at.While most of the game is standard platform fare, there are some diversions. Notably, there are a number of cart racing tracks which can be played with a friend. Additionally, there are missions that will place the player in giant robots, each with a different speciality (one is good at battle, one can put out fires, one is a submarine, etc.).There are many comedic quirks, having the players throw electrified boomerangs at robotic dinosaurs in the Outback, then send them up in a helicopter to rescue sheep stranded by a flood, then have them clear a road following a traffic accident. And finally, to top it all off, the save/continue points are outhouses.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Kururin Squash!</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-10-14</td><td>Nintendo Co., Ltd.</td><td>Eighting Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade</td><td></td><td>Helicopter</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">After two adventures on the Game Boy Advance, Kururin goes 3D on the GameCube.

They built energy controllers to harness the "light of Aether" to prolong the life of their planet and its inhabitants. After many ages of peace and prosperity, a meteor collided with the planet; this collision opened a dimensional rift into another world, called Dark Aether. From this world came an evil race of beings known as the Ing, and for many ages a war was fought between the Ing of the dark world and the Luminoth of the light world. Over time the Ing began winning, turning the light world to dark. At about this time, a federation spacecraft happens to be chasing a Space Pirate vessel, which is destroyed by the Ing, through the area. Wondering about the fate of this craft, the Galactic Federation sends an urgent message to Samus Aran, asking her to find the crew and investigate the planet Aether.This is the sequel to Metroid Prime where players once again control bounty hunter Samus Aran as she arrives on Aether.

When one player hits another player with a powerful attack, some of their coins will drop, which can be collected. Coins may also be found throughout the landscape, and the player with the most coins at the end wins.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Need for Speed: Underground 2</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-11-15</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Electronic Arts Black Box</td><td>Racing / Driving</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Arcade</td><td></td><td>Automobile, Street racing, Vehicle simulator</td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This installment in the Need for Speed series, Underground 2 is a racing game based on illicit, night time races, with the player gaining street credit, cash and access to unique tuner parts by schooling the competition.Taking place in a massive, open city, NFS Underground 2 allows players to explore the city at will, engaging random challengers and moving into the coveted Underground Racing League.

After a series of FBI Agents swipe your ship, what option do you have other than to blow up everything in your path to get it back?Alien Hominid is a 2D side-scrolling shooter with heavy references to the Metal Slug series of games - from the hand-drawn graphics, huge explosions, right down to the ability to eviscerate FBI Agents when you get up close to them.  The graphics are by featured artist Dan Paladin.  Your goal, is quite simply, to get to the end of the stage, and die as little as possible.  Which is made difficult due to the fact that any bullet is an instant kill.To help you out, you can grab a range of power-ups, such as lasers, spread shots, shotguns, and more, as well as hijacking vehicles and using them for protection.  Grenades can be lobbed, and you can jump on enemy shoulders and choose to bite their heads off if you like, or pick them up and throw them at other enemies.  You can also dive underground for a short period of time to avoid enemies - while underground, you can drag agents into the ground to kill them.The GBA version of the game is identical in gameplay, however, with a few bosses removed (such as the robot bee and the FBI big-fisted tank robot).  The PlayStation 2, Xbox and Xbox 360 versions of the game include a special "PDA Game" with very simple-looking graphics.  Your goal in this game is to kill all the agents by hopping on their heads and then reaching the exit.  Included with this game is a level editor, allowing you to make your own levels and then send them to friends if you have the Xbox or Xbox 360 version.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Prince of Persia: Warrior Within</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-11-30</td><td>Ubisoft, Inc.</td><td>Ubisoft Entertainment Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Platform, Puzzle elements</td><td>Fantasy, Middle East</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Prince of Persia: Warrior Within is the direct sequel to Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Seven years later, the Prince is hunted by a monster known as Dahaka. He finds out that anyone who manipulates the Sands of Time is destined to die shortly afterwards; but the Prince has escaped his fate, and that's the reason for Dahaka's rage. Now the Prince must travel to the mysterious Island of Time, where he hopes to find the Empress of Time and, through time manipulation, somehow prevent her from creating the Sands in the first place...The game comes with a new, darker look for the Prince and his surroundings. The fights are more brutal and take a larger part in the game, as the Prince now has enhanced fighting moves including new attack moves via walls and poles.Even though the fights make up a large part of the game, the puzzle sections are still present and more complicated than before. A new move in the puzzle sections of the game is the curtain slide, which allows you to slide down to the ground slowly. There are still plenty of options for time manipulation and the storyline also lets you travel back and forth in time, visiting the same locations in an alternate time period.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Cabela's Big Game Hunter 2005 Adventures</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-12-01</td><td>Activision Value Publishing, Inc.</td><td>Magic Wand Productions</td><td>Action, Simulation, Sports</td><td></td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Hunting</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Another in the Big Game Hunting series, 2005 Adventures brings you 36 big game animals in 10 locations.

Multiplayer is available on the PS2, PSP and Xbox versions. In singleplayer, there are various game modes such as NFL Challenge where the player has 150 days to build a team to take on a squad of legends. Progress is based on milestones where you sharpen specific skills to reach the top or beat sufficient teams. When five days are left, the team enters a final tournament.Another one is the new Own the City mode, where the player create a new character and has to win all street games in the city. New players need to be recruited from pick-up games. The final team to beat consists of rapper Xzibit and a team of NFL stars.

Kennedy to Europe on a top-secret mission to investigate the disappearance of the president's daughter Ashley. As Leon encounters unimaginable horrors, he must find out who or what is behind everything. Old friends...and enemies...lurk around every corner as Leon attempts to find out who is truly behind the kidnapping of the president's daughter.Resident Evil 4 is a major change from the previous installments. Instead of a fixed third-person perspective, the game features a new "behind the back" movement camera angle and an "over the shoulder" aiming feature that allows players to control their gun movement for specific body part hits. It features a brand new AI system and more open environments that allow enemies to work together to capture and corner Leon. Enemies are now humans, which allows them to climb up ladders, open doors, and use weapons throughout the game. The entire item system has also been revamped, so that smaller items no longer require an entire item space to hold. Instead, items take up blocks of space in a briefcase according to their real-life size, to allow for many more items and weapons. Leon can collect treasure from enemies or from the surrounding area, and visit the infamous "merchant" to purchase bigger briefcases, treasure maps, weapons upgrades, and powerful weapons such as the one-shot RPG.There is also the Mercenaries from Resident Evil 3, which allows the player to play survival scenarios as characters such as Hunk and even Albert Wesker himself.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Resident Evil 4 (Gamestop Special Edition)</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-01-11</td><td>Capcom Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Capcom Production Studio 4</td><td>Action</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td>Horror</td><td>Puzzle elements, Shooter</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This edition of Resident Evil 4 is exclusive to the US retailer Gamestop.

Each adventure consists of tasks and problems Pooh has to help solve in order to ensure his friends have the best birthday ever. Pooh can interact with many different elements around him.  For example, if there's a box blocking his way, have Pooh push it away.  Gopher is always nearby to pop up and give Pooh tips on what he has to do and how to do it.  Pooh will also have to talk to other characters to complete his tasks.  For example, in Piglet's Birthday, you will have to find Kenga and borrow her broom for Piglet.  Some tasks will require the help of Pooh's friends.  For instance, you will have to help Roo collect butterflies for Piglet's birthday by climbing on Eeyore's back and running after the butterflies.Every now and then Pooh will be confronted by Heffalumps and Woozles.

The last rehash of the engine debuted on FIFA 2003, it draws most of it's gameplay elements from the 2005 edition, but with some changes to gameplay such as a slightly more aggressive AI on attack (reducing the need to constantly push players forward using the Off The Ball controls, still present), new refereeing aspects such as some deliberate errors (as in occasional bad offside calls or throw-ins, not cheating the player through mistakes),  advantage rule and handballs and a new set piece system, which replaces the much criticized "targeting" and "push and shove" featured in 2005. This system is much less rigid and less formulaic, as a directional arrow and powerbars define how balls are crossed and there are four player movement setups, thus making each corner and indirect free kicks different. For direct free kicks, players have the option to take driven or curved shots or drop a pass to a nearby player to explore a gap in the defense. All options are available at all times, instead of being determined by the distance to goal. 
Many of these changes were later adapted into the new FIFA 06 engine, and it was also chosen as the match engine for subsequent Bright Future's  FIFA Manager. The presentation takes notes from real television broadcasts, with goals, fouls and attempts on goal being recapped not only in the full-time highlight reel but also during game stoppages and PiP popups. As the game is presented in a faux letterboxed format, next to the scoreline some statistics occasionally popup, allowing to keep track of them for some missions. A very requested feature, the ability to see the energy bars of the closest players to the ball of both teams, was finally included, as well as icons for the special abilities (speed, shooting, dribbling or tackling) of the best players.The Champions League, where the player leads one team to the Final in the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, in the quest to succeed FC Porto as European Champions, is one of the available modes, but not the most important. That honour goes to the "The Season" mode, where the player starts by creating his managing avatar, and then proceeds to a a series of 50 missions, with the first being a close last-week match against a Champions League spot rival, proceeding with a buyout of the club and increased expectations, and (hopefully) closing with the Champions League final.  This mode also allows players to unlock additional features such as balls, a stadium and special exhibition modes by fulfilling objectives set by the club president during the season, some of them crucial matches (which can result in a sacking if  failed), others simply a matter of balancing the squad. Other modes include the usual friendlies, "home and away" (a two-legged friendly), scenarios (where the player can create situations such as a defending a 1-0 nil for 45 minutes while two man down) and practice.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">NBA Street V3</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-02-08</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Electronic Arts Canada</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Tricks / stunts</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Bring your game to the street in EA's third installment of the NBA Street franchise.

The creation of this force is seen as a violation of international law and Japan's constitution, and it causes tensions to rise between Japan, China, and North Korea. In time, North Korea and China set up shipping blockades around Japan, and Japan calls on the United States for help, citing article nine of the Postwar Constitution. Throughout this time, Japan uncovers more and more information that the infamous Black Gold Day was caused by intentional information warfare attacks. As the U.S. prepares to launch the USS Clarence E. Walsh, Third Echelon sends the famous Sam Fisher on a mission that appears to be unrelated to the incident, but which may end up being the most important element of it all.In Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, players take on the role of field operative Sam Fisher for a third outing. Fisher has some new moves this time around, and he also has a new weapon always at his disposal; a combat knife. Utilizing the knife, Sam can either kill his enemies, or simply knock them out. At the end of each mission, the player is given an overview of how they did. The more people that the player spares, the better the success score.The single-player game is more open-ended than the past two Splinter Cell games. While players are still forced through some areas in a "tunnel" like fashion, with no choice of where to go, there are many instances where they can decide how they'd like to get there. For example, in the caverns, one can either kill two enemies and cross the bridge, or leave them alone, sneak along the side path, and climb a ladder at the end, bypassing the fight entirely, but still winding up in the same location.Throughout the game many different locations are visited, such as a lighthouse, a Japanese tea house, Seoul, New York City during an East Coast blackout, and other such exotic locales.The Spies-vs-Mercs multiplayer mode that appeared in the previous game has returned, with some new features.

Unlike many licensed titles, this third-person action game in the vein of the Onimusha or Devil May Cry series only takes the base of its plot from the actual movie, then liberally changes it to make for better gameplay.Generally, the game brings in more content from the comic books than the movie, particularly considering the villains that appear. While the movie pretty much only concerned itself with Victor von Doom aka "Doctor Doom" as its supervillain of choice, the game brings in various characters from the comic books as well - the Mole Man, the Puppet Master, or Diablo, to name a few.The gameplay usually consists of walking the heroic title characters around a level and beating up the various enemies that cross their path. There are mission objectives, but usually, the only way to achieve them leads through the enemies, and just, as usual, the only way to fail them is to be overwhelmed by the Bad Guys. Beating up enemies yields points, which can be used to upgrade characters with new special moves or unlock various bonus materials.To spice it all up, developer Seven Studios have also thrown in a co-op mode that allows for playing the normal single-player mission in a tag team with a second player.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Killer7</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-07-07</td><td>Capcom Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Capcom Production Studio 4, Grasshopper Manufacture Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person, 3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td>Puzzle elements, Shooter</td><td>Contemporary, Japan (Modern/Futuristic)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td>Cinematic camera</td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In an alternate version of the Earth's history, a treaty was signed in the early 21st century, during which all countries willingly destroyed their nuclear arsenals, ending international conflicts. The presumed era of world peace, however, is marred by continuous attacks carried out by a new terrorist group called "Heaven Smile", which consists of human mutants under the influence of a lethal virus, and targets the United Nations and the International Ethics Committee (IEC). Meanwhile, the relationship between the United States and Japan deteriorates, as the latter becomes controlled by a party that proposes to sever connections to the USA.A group of assassins known as Killer7 is hired by a man named Christopher Mills, on behalf of the US government. The group is led by an elderly wheelchair-bound man named Harman Smith, endowed with an ability known as "Multifoliate Personae Phenomenon", which allows him to transform into seven different personalities who were professional assassins in their lives, and whose souls were absorbed by Harman after they were killed in a mysterious incident fifty years ago. Garcian Smith is the leading persona among these seven, and the only one who can communicate with Harman.Killer7 is a hybrid game that incorporates shooting and puzzle-solving with light role-playing elements. The player can switch between any of the seven characters during most parts of the game. Each character has unique abilities. Dan, for example, is a true marksman, while Coyote is an experienced thief with exceptional movement. The unusual cast also includes the blind Con who moves very fast, Kaede with ranged skills, Mask who has the deadliest arsenal, the albino Kevin who can turn invisible, as well as Garcian, the leader of the pack who possesses the ability to revive the bodies of slain personalities. Despite its 3D environments, character navigation in the game is restricted: playable characters can only move along pre-determined (though often branching) paths. Drawing out a weapon switches the view to a first-person perspective with free camera rotation, but no possibility to move. Typically, the player should eliminate the approaching enemy as quickly as possible before sustaining damage, using various combinations of characters and weapons. Defeated enemies (particularly those dispatched with critical hits) yield the player "blood", which can be turned into serum in special rooms and used to enhance the abilities of the characters. A considerable portion of the gameplay is dedicated to solving various puzzles and gathering plot-related information by conversing with the game's exotic characters.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Jikkyō Powerful Pro Yakyū 12</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-07-14</td><td>Konami Corporation</td><td>Pawapuro Production</td><td>Sports</td><td>Behind view, Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Jikkyō Powerful Pro Yakyū 12 is the 12th installment in the series of baseball games by Konami.

So they play ball games with each other to decide who should play Bowser. The rules are the same as any other baseball game with some exceptions. Like other baseball games, each team gets three strikes, three outs, and four balls per inning. However, you can choose to play less than nine innings. You can also choose from Exhibition, Challenge, Toy Field, and Mini-game modes:

Exhibition mode is one game between two teams.
In Challenge mode, you choose a team to play every other team; you can get the other teams characters by completing certain challenges. When you beat the other teams, you get a chance to play Bowser's team.
In Toy Field mode, up to four players take turns to get the most points; players receive points by hitting the ball at certain spots, which consist of out, 1, 2, or 3-hits, or homerun spots. You can get a turn by catching the ball when your opponent hits the ball.
At the start of Exhibition and Challenge modes, you choose your team captain. In Exhibition mode, you also choose team members, but in Challenge mode, your team members depend on which captain you pick.All the team captains have star pitches and star hits. The characters can also pitch fastballs and change-ups.

If all stamina is gone, the player won't be able to control the wrestler. In addition, players can perform up to four unique submission moves. The game displays injuries sustained by the wrestlers, ranging from a small cut on the forehead to a face or a chest covered by blood, which may also drip onto the mat and stay there. A new type of match called The Last Man Standing is included in the game. In this match type the wrestlers are counted out while stunned.

This installment features cel shaded graphics, 14 characters in total – 5 playable and 9 that you have to unlock – and has 5 modes for you to play and 2 others where you can view unlocked art of the characters.The Grand Battle mode is where you can fight against human players or CPU players and has most of the characters unlocked from the beginning.
Story Mode is where you’ll spend most of your time since this is where you can unlock the rest of your characters and other staff like screenshots of the anime.
Mini Games, as the name implies is a mode for playing mini games. Usopp Pirates challenge you to a series of 3 mini games. You begin by selecting three players for your team and each time you win a game you can select a member of the team that lost. Of course the opposite can also happen if you lose a game.
Grand Tourney is a multiplayer battle tournament where you can set up to 16 human or CPU players to compete.
I believe Training mode is pretty much self explanatory.
And there are also 2 other modes – Treasure and One Piece Art. Basically this is where you can find all the staff you have unlocked like character endings, costume art and staff like that.Characters have basically the same button presses to perform attacks. Other than that each one has a support character that he can call to aid in the battle and 2 different unique attacks that can be used if certain conditions are met. There is also another unique attack for each character, with a long animated sequence that if you use when low on energy the enemy can be defeated with only one blow.

The same stick is used to increase the accuracy when shooting. While preparing for a shot, a bull's-eye appears in the enemy goal and you can quickly move the target to the corners for precision. To add to the individual qualities, statistics such as speed and size are now reflected during gameplay in the players' momentum and turning radius. To get past opponents quickly, you can generate momentum for quick speed boosts.With the introduction of R.P.M. (Realistic Puck Momentum) dynamics, there is more randomness with the puck, as a shot off the mask can now stun goalies. Another small addition is the deformation of the ice during the match. In the player creation mode, where you can now apply bruises, broken noses, black eyes and scars to your players, the thumbstick is used for "face sculpting" - changing the different features.All the regular game modes are present, of which the Dynasty Mode from the previous version is the most complete, with scouting and full management options, inside and outside the arena. Contrary to the last game, you can now intervene during simulated AI games and win the match for your team.The PC, PS2 and Xbox version support online multiplayer games, and as a special bonus, the original NHL 94 game, one of the first in the series, has been included with the PS2 edition.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Scooby-Doo!: Unmasked</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-09-12</td><td>THQ Inc.</td><td>Artificial Mind & Movement</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td>Detective / mystery</td><td>Puzzle elements</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Fred brings the rest of Mystery, Inc. along to meet his cousin, Jed, who works at the Monstrous Fright & Magic.

Unmasked can be saved at any point in the game simply by selecting Save Game in the Pause Menu.  You can also turn on the Autosave function which will enable the game to automatically save at different points.

At first, the heroes must rescue Professor X, who has fallen into the clutches of the enemy. However, when Apocalypse kidnaps Magneto's son Quicksilver, the leader of the Brotherhood is determined more than ever to team up with his former foes and stop Apocalypse's evil plans.X-Men: Legends II - Rise of Apocalypse is an action role-playing game and a sequel to X-Men Legends. The player controls a party of four characters, though only one at a time can be controlled directly. Beside switching the characters for combat purposes, the player is often obliged to do so, because some of the tasks in the game require the specific abilities of a certain mutant. For example, Iceman can put out fire, Magneto can generate a metal bridge across a gap, etc.. Most of the time, however, is spent in combat, collecting loot and acquiring experience points. Unlike the first game, items dropped by enemies are random. The character will level up, become stronger, and learn new skills. The player can opt to allocate all the experience and skill points manually.Each character has several different skills based on their mutant powers. These include melee, boost, projectile, traps, and others. Each character can also learn powerful super skill: for example, Cyclops has a super beam attack that can hit multiple targets; Wolverine has a spinning attack that inflicts heavy damage; Magneto has a metal attack, crushing everything in sight by manipulating metal objects in the environment, etc.New in the sequel is on-line multiplayer with both co-operative and six competitive modes.

Once again, you play as Domingo 'Ding' Chavez, leading a small commando team on black-ops missions. This time, however, the developer strays from the realistic squad-based action in favor of more arcadish gameplay. The main single player campaign is based around a dangerous virus and hostages. In certain missions, you play as sniper Dieter Weber, picking off terrorists from higher ground and providing cover while the team infiltrates the building.The differences between the console versions are the number of missions and the availability of certain gadgets. There is an offline two-player, split-screen cooperative mode available (up to 4 over Xbox live) and full online multiplayer up to 16 players featuring traditional deathmatch, objective-based games and CTF modes, on Xbox and PS2. While the PS2 version includes a Rivalry mode, Xbox online multiplayer has an RPG element: the P.E.C. mode (Persistent Elite Creation). Before playing, you choose an avatar and a class with specific abilities (commando, engineer, spec op and medic). While playing, you earn credits and experience, which can be traded in for new weapons, items or armour. Gear regularly needs to be repaired, shown by the durability level, and experience can be used to assign skills points to abilities, individualizing your character.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-10-03</td><td>Nintendo of America Inc.</td><td>Genius Sonority, Inc.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Japanese-style RPG (JRPG)</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">You play a young Pokémon Trainer in the Orre Region, two years after the events of Pokémon Colosseum.

Also new is the concept of "Team Chemistry"  which affects how well a team plays collectively. Featuring 26 leagues from 19 countries, 29 real stadiums and over 10'000 players with data for the 2005-06 seasons, as well as international teams, the game kept the "Create a player" feature as well as the many managing options untouched from previous versions. Career mode, the 15-year long climb to the top of the game, features new options such as sponsorships (which will only accept good results), player contracts and more weight on the player morale: a demoralized player (usually from not playing or possible influence from random events) is more likely to underperform as well as pressuring the "Team Chemistry" values downwards and might refuse attempts to renew his contract, leaving on a free transfer.While there are still many unlockables in the game (mostly third kits), the way to earn points changed. Instead of gaining points from completing tasks (from entering the EA Trax or creating a player to winning the Champions League or completing a career), the player has over 100 scenarios to way in five difficulty levels.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Codename: Kids Next Door - Operation: V.I.D.E.O.G.A.M.E.</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-10-11</td><td>Global Star Software Inc.</td><td>High Voltage Software, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Puzzle elements</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone 10+</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This action/adventure platformer is based on the Cartoon Network show Codename: Kids Next Door.

Players take control of over thirty characters to play through key moments from The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. The storyline includes most of the important events in the movies, omitting or adding a few sequences. The presentation of these events, however, is humorous, with all the characters and environments made out of LEGO bricks. Objects would often break apart like physical LEGO bricks, characters have comical expressions, and all dialogue from corresponding events from the movies is replaced by gestures.The basic gameplay is action with platforming and light puzzle-solving elements. Players navigate two or more characters through stages, each representing a chapter in a movie. These chapters must be unlocked in a plot-dictated order, eventually completing the entire movie. Characters use different weapons (blasters, lightsabers, crossbows, etc.), and each character type also possesses specific abilities. For example, Jedi can use the force to lift, combine, and destroy objects; robots can unlock encrypted doors; other characters may use a grappling hook to access higher platforms, etc. Some of these abilities overlap (i.e. a problem can be solved in more than one way), though often a specific type of character is required to deal with the situation. In the single-player mode, one player can switch between the available characters; in the co-op mode, two players navigate at least two different characters.A few levels involve players piloting aircraft, fighting hostile vehicles, overcoming obstacles or destroying targets on the ground. The Free Mode allows players to access previously visited stages with any characters they have unlocked. This may lead to a discovery of previously inaccessible areas. Various collectible items and LEGO studs (which serve as currency) can be gathered during exploration. Characters cannot permanently die in the game; when a character is killed, he or she only loses collected LEGO studs.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Shrek SuperSlam</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-10-25</td><td>Activision Publishing, Inc.</td><td>Shaba Games LLC</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Fighting, Platform</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone 10+</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Shrek SuperSlam is an intense brawling game that challenges the wacky characters from the Shrek universe to beat each other up and slam them across a variety of arenas.

Accompanied by its talkative guide Telly Vision, Chibi-Robo makes its way through the dysfunctional Sanderson household, trying its best to make the family members happy. It won't be easy though - their daughter thinks she's a frog, the wife is furious at the husband for wasting money and makes him sleep on the couch, and, if that wasn't enough, there are reports of spider-like robots out to destroy Chibi-Robo!Chibi-Robo!: Plug into Adventure! is a platform adventure with a difference - players control a small robot, whose short size means that regular objects like furniture and stairs become gargantuan obstacles for it to overcome. Its battery is consistently draining while not plugged into a wall outlet, and its power consumption increases when it uses tools like its blaster, copter, or radar. Because of this, players must keep an eye on their remaining power and regularly recharge.The aim of the game is to earn Happy Points to increase Chibi-Robo's rank and become Super Chibi-Robo. This can be achieved by performing simple tasks (such as throwing away trash or cleaning floor stains like muddy footprints) or by making its owners happy, for example by giving a rose as a gift to Jenny, the frog-obsessed daughter. This role-playing aspect of the game is similar to the gathering of "love points" in Moon: Remix RPG Adventure.Also similarly to Moon and some of its spiritual followers (such as Giftpia), the game world is populated by rather exotic characters, all of which talk in a mysterious gibberish language, with subtitles displayed on the screen.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Sonic Riders</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-02-21</td><td>SEGA of America, Inc.</td><td>Now Production Co., Ltd., Sonic Team</td><td>Racing / Driving</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade</td><td></td><td>Automobile, Track racing, Vehicle simulator</td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In Sonic Riders, Dr. Eggman challenges Sonic and his friends to a Worldwide Grand Prix, and the prize for coming out on top is an ultra-rare Chaos Emerald!

You are in control of a giant steel ball, called the Odama, which you use to crush the enemy army (and hopefully not your own soldiers) so that you have an easier time leading the Ninten Bell to its destination.The game also takes of advantage of the GCN microphone (included with most versions of the game), which you use to command your troops. You must use the commands and pinball skills to successfully lead the Ninten Bell to its destination before sunset in each mission.Using the L+R buttons to control the flippers, the X button to activate the microphone, and the control stick to tilt the battlefield, the controls in Odama are quite simple for today's standards.  In each mission, you, representing the Yamanouchi clan, try to bring the clan's powerful treasure, the Ninten Bell, as well as the Odama, closer to the Karasuma Keep, headed by the man who betrayed the founder of the Yamanouchi clan.  It is there you will exact revenge for his betrayal.  Notably, the game features a narrator that talks about the story in Japanese, but there are English subtitles.The basic goal of each mission is to guide the bell from the bottom to the top of the screen, mowing down the members of the opposing army with the Odama, as well as killing them with your own soldiers.  It is important that they are killed because, if they reach your side of the screen, they will make the flippers inactive for a relatively long period of time.  When all Odamas are lost or the sun sets, you fail the mission.  In addition, you learn commands for your soldiers as you progress through the game.  Using these commands, you'll be able to more effectively control your soldiers in many ways.  For example, by saying, "press forward," your troops will use all of their strength to try and plow through enemy soldiers.  These commands are not only very useful, but in many cases, are vital to your success.However, use of certain commands and reckless use of the Odama drains your Morale Bar.  When this bar is low, your troops will stop responding to your commands, which can and will be disastrous to your mission.There are also items that the Odama can pick up along the way to aid you.  Most notably is one that allows the Odama to convert all members of the opposing army over to yours when it rolls them over.In merging all of these elements, Odama is a very fast, difficult, and frenzied title. Although it is a pinball game at its core, the voice commands, power-ups, and storyline throw it into a league of its own.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">FIFA World Cup: Germany 2006</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-04-24</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Electronic Arts Canada</td><td>Sports</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td>Europe</td><td></td><td>Direct control, Multiple units/characters control</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Released one month before the actual World Cup 2006, this game lets players play all the matches before they even started.

At the tenth level of each city, players face off against a boss character, Dr. Vector - if you destroy his dangerous machines as well as levelling the city, you'll receive a bonus.A new feature of Rampage: Total Destruction is the ability to climb on the front of buildings.  Instead of just climbing the sides and standing on the top of buildings, players can now smash the buildings from the front as well.  However, there is an added danger to this - people now hurl objects like televisions out their windows in an attempt to try and stop you.The game also includes two previous games from the series as a bonus - the original Rampage, and Rampage World Tour.

And to top it all off, the prince and princess of the neighboring islands have gone missing on Jungle Island - if they aren't found and returned, there's sure to be trouble!

As you win money from races, you can visit garages and car lots to make improvements to your vehicle.Enhancements are still unlocked gradually, but the cars have now been divided over different tiers.

The PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 versions offer online multiplayer, missing from the PS2, GC and Xbox releases. Up to eight players can race together, in the Pursuit Tag or Pursuit Knockout modes, with a few variations. Pursuit Tag is a race of one civilian car against cop cars. To become the civilian car, you have to tag it and then try to fend off the cops as long as possible until you are tagged again by other players. In Pursuit Knockout everyone starts as a civilian car, but the last one at the end of the first lap becomes a cop and needs to cause as much damage as possible to the other speeders. Another mode allows you to drive cooperatively (up to four players) in a single race.The city and the surroundings in the career mode have been divided into different territories, controlled by gangs. You are either invited or challenged to race in the sections and claim them as your own. To do so, you have to impress the gang leader by winning races until he challenges you for a duel - first in the city, then over the narrow roads of Carbon Canyon. Scores are based on proximity. You need to follow the boss in the first race, and he is in pursuit in the second one. There are 4 boss duels in total.The crew feature, with room for up to 6 cars, allows you to assign three roles to racers: drafters, scouts and blockers. These are supporting characters you can hire to help you win races.

If you hire a scout, you get access to the new AutoSculpt feature. It enables you to modify the height of every part of your car through sliders, solely for visual effect.

Presumed dead along with a team of graduate students after an accident in a tomb in Peru, where Lara was the only one to escape, Amanda is back with a score to settle as they both race, along with the shady James Rutland Jr., to obtain an ancient artifact. Many other characters, both friends and foes, will stir things up. The story takes Lara through locations all over the world, from the Himalayas to Ghana, Kazakhstan, Bolivia, Japan, and England, including her famous mansion filled with secrets and collectibles. Aside from current events, Lara's past is also revealed, through flashbacks. Among other things, you will get to know how she lost her mother and why it is such a burden.The typical third-person action-adventuring exploring is still present. Lara can move more freely and is no longer limited by specific jumps. As you travel through rough environments, you will need to run, dive, swim, climb on poles, ladders, roofs, use zip lines, shimmy, and vault, with acrobatic actions such as somersaults and flips. You need to cross difficult terrain, solve puzzles to advance or open up new areas, and engage in combat. New tools include a grappling hook, not only used to move around but also to haul enemies Scorpion-style, binoculars, a PLS (personal light source), flares, a PDA and a headset to keep in contact with tech support Zip.Enemies are still rather scarce. Both humans and animals will attack you, and the game retains the auto lock-on mode, but now with a slide attack and close combat with both kicks and punches, plus bullet-time actions to get behind enemies quickly. Lara carries her trademark dual-wielded pistols, but can also pick up new weapons along the way, such as a shotgun and grenades. Missions take place in both indoor and outdoor environments, with arcade motorcycle and jeep sequences in between. As usual, Lara has a fancy outfit for each location.The PSP version includes the full game and adds a multiplayer mode: Tomb Trials. You can race another player through tombs to see who comes out first, or go on a timed scavenger hunt for artifacts.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Shrek Smash N' Crash Racing</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-11-28</td><td>Activision Publishing, Inc.</td><td>Torus Games Pty.

At first, Link is a simple farm boy, whose tasks consist of herding goats to watching children in Ordon village, Link's hometown. One day, Link is asked by the mayor to run an errand in Castle Town, but things suddenly go wrong…The land becomes dark, and strange creatures appear from another world called the Twilight Realm, which turns most into ghosts. Link, however, becomes a wolf. After becoming a wolf, Link is aided by Midna, a resident of the Twilight Realm. Midna helps Link find a way to turn human again along with other tasks.The wolf cannot use a sword or other items. Instead, as a wolf Link must use his senses to solve puzzles and get past obstacles. The beast can also dig holes to find hearts and rupees and to get in places. It can push blocks with its head to climb higher or reveal hidden passageways. Additionally, it can attack enemies by biting or pouncing on them.As a human, Link can move around quickly, aim his bow, swing his sword, and even fish. Link also collects many different items, which allow him to perform varied attacks and reach places he couldn't before. Link performs many attacks with his sword and can even learn other sword moves.The game's art is similar to the naturalistic style of Ocarina of Time, rather than the cel-shaded look of The Wind Waker. Chronologically, the game takes place between the two aforementioned titles, and quite a few locations from Ocarina of Time can be visited. The main adventure takes place in several provinces with dungeons and temples. With the help of Midna, you can easily travel around quickly later in the game.The Wii U remaster of the game includes:

Take control of your favourite turtle ninjas as you play through the events of the 2007 CGI movie.  Leonardo returns from his meditation in South America to find his family in disarray, and crime on the rise in New York.  A mysterious figure calling himself the "Nightwatcher" has turned up, and a shadowy rich man named Winters seems to be in cahoots with the remnants of the Foot Clan.  Only the Ninja Turtles can clean up the streets!TMNT is an action game, similar to Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time.  Play as Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello, swapping on the fly and using special co-operative moves to help your brothers in battle.  Each turtle, being a ninja, can perform moves like double jumping, running along and up walls, gripping onto tiny cracks in the walls, and jumping from wall to wall to scale dizzying heights.  Most of the game is spent making your way to the next destination by using your ninja moves to explore New York.  Each character also has their own special move: Leo can traverse through walls, Raph can use his Sais to scale particular surfaces, Mikey can use his Nunchucks as helicopters to float for a short period, and Don can pole vault across long gaps with his Bo Staff.Sometimes, battles will occur - in these situations, you'll be locked in an arena and must battle all your enemies before you can move on.  Battling is a simple affair - you can use one button for standard attacks (charge it for a more powerful one), and another button for light attacks that push enemies away.  If your fellow turtles are with you, you can also hold down your character swap button for a tandem co-op attack.  Some levels will allow you to play as the Nightwatcher - he fights similarly to the Turtles, except that as the more he fights, the more his 'rage' builds, which can cause a devastating surrounding attack when fully charged.  The Wii version of the game controls similarly to all other versions, except that gestures are used for attacking instead of button presses.The basic goal for each level is to get to the end.  At the end of each level, you're graded on the following attributes: your speed, your combat, and the amount of coins collected.  In levels where you work with your brothers, you'll also be graded on how well you worked together.  Succeed in a these attributes, and you'll earn turtle coins which can be used to purchase unlockables.  If you get an A Rank or higher in a level, you'll also unlock a Challenge Map, which can be played to earn even more turtle coins.  Finally, once you've played any level at least once, turtle coins will appear in hard-to-reach spots for you to collect.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Meet the Robinsons</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2007-03-27</td><td>Disney Interactive Studios, Inc.</td><td>Avalanche Software LLC</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone 10+</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Meet the Robinsons is based on the animated movie of the same name, but acts as a sequel to it.

The graphics are on the cartoony side and the play on the field mostly arcade oriented. The majority of time is spent with batting or pitching which rely on timing,  there is also active fielding and management of the base runners. Power-ups can be activated when the power meter is filled up and give certain advantages, e.g. the "split ball" power-up for pitchers causes the ball to divide into two. There are various difficulty options that can be turned on or off like automatic fielding or deactivating bat aim (when activated, the player actively has to aim into the direction the ball is supposed to fly).The game modes are quick matches (also available for two players), a season mode with the ability to change the lineup and some statistics, and two mini-games (Home Run Derby and Fielder's Challenge which is basically fielding training). The player can either use pre-defined or customized teams and some things (e.g. the young MLB athletes or better leagues to play in) have to be unlocked by completing achievements.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Surf's Up</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2007-05-29</td><td>Ubisoft, Inc.</td><td>Ubisoft Entertainment Inc.</td><td>Sports</td><td>Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone 10+</td><td></td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Surf’s Up is a surfing game based on the movie of the same name.

The version by Asobo Studio is, like other versions, a 3D platform game, but has its own design, levels and missions.The game follows the plot of the film only loosely, but has the main voice cast from the movie reprising their roles. The player controls Remy, a rat with a refined sense of taste. When Remy finds himself in Paris near the restaurant of the famous deceased chef Gusteau, he works on making his dream of becoming a chef himself come true, while helping out his fellow rats to procure food.While many of the environments in the game are similar to those in the next-generation version, this version has almost none of the open world elements seen in the other title, with smaller levels and mostly linear progress. To get around in the various levels that include the sewers, streets and rooftops of Paris, the restaurant kitchen and a food market, Remy can jump and double-jump, swing along poles, balance on ropes, crawl on certain walls and defend himself with tail swipes or by using spoons as weapons. He can also engage his keen sense of smell, which displays the path to the next goal or objective. Sometimes, Remy must evade guards by hiding out of sight until their attention wanes. Other sequences in the levels involve sliding down pipes, rafting through water currents and fleeing from humans that chase Remy. Another large part are mini-games, many of which involve cooking, with Remy having to pick ingredients or peel potatoes.There are some optional bonus missions, taking the form of dream sequences, in which Remy navigates landscapes made of foodstuffs. All levels include many collectibles. In most levels there will be up to 100 stars to collect. Special items in certain levels include batteries, darts or lightbulbs. Collecting all of a certain kind of item in an area awards bonus points, which can be spent in Gusteau's shop to unlock bonuses, including various kinds of artwork as well as the possibility to play the mini-games outside the main game, in both single and multiplayer modes.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Madden NFL 08</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2007-08-14</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>EA Tiburon</td><td>Sports</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Daniel Henuber, Alex McClung</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">EA Sports' 2008 edition in the Madden series has some new features along with an updated roster and some new animations.

Visually and acoustically the game is resembling platform games from the early 90s. You start the game with 6 lives, but due to tricky passages it's almost impossible to beat even the first level on the first run. In contrast to a few other games (e.g. Eryi's Action) the difficulty is not caused by unforseen traps, but by the need of good reflexes and problem solving skills instead.Like previous games in the series also this part has some basic back story to it: Our hero Sqrxz is on vacation with his girlfriend Yve, when an "evil power" suddenly kidnaps Yve and forces you to collect all rings spread in the 10 levels - when you missed a ring you will not be able to exit a level. The causes of death are numerous, among others touching spikes or enemies, drowning, being squashed or falling into a pit. When dying you have to restart from the beginning of the level or the last checkpoint - but you do have unlimited continues, with the only penalty loosing your score and having to restart the level from the beginning.Controls are simplistic: You can only move to the left / right, jump and move slowly. Jumping onto some kinds of enemies will kill or stun them, and basic interaction with the environment is done by touching an item to activate it or pushing a crate to move it.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Xump: The Final Run</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2015-05-14</td><td>Retroguru</td><td></td><td>Puzzle</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>GameCube</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This version of Xump is an extended remake of the puzzle game Xump: The Final Run (which in turn is similar to the C64 game Sensitive) with improved graphics and new levels.The goal is still the same: With your bot "Xump" you will have to remove all blue tiles on platforms somewhere in the sky by moving over them. A bit of planning is required, as you (obviously) can move onto such a blue tile only once. The levels have a time limit, so it's required to think quickly.Apart from the blue tiles the game also contains solid grey tiles that won't disappear, teleporters to move between two locations, bombs that act as a second layer for the tile (so you have to visit the tile twice to remove it) and arrows that will automatically push you into the arrow's direction.</td></tr></table>
