These are the shortest races in the game.This game can be played by two players.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Arctic Thunder</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2001-11-15</td><td>Midway Home Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Midway Games, Inc.</td><td>Racing / Driving</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Snowmobile</td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Arctic Thunder, the fourth installment in Midway's arcade racing series, is a fantasy snowmobile-racing game that plays like a mix of Cruis'n and a kart racer on ice.

Your hero is Master Chief, who is given no name beyond his rank in the game itself. He is stationed on the Pillar of Autumn, a ship which, per protocol makes a jump in a random direction to retreat to avoid revealing the location of Earth. They find themselves at the titular Halo, a planet-sized ring of mysterious origin, and function with the Covenant on their heels.  Master Chief must repel the Covenant assault and discover the secrets of Halo with the assistance of the female AI Cortana who lives in his suit and gives missions.Halo: Combat Evolved is a sci-fi first-person shooter with considerable driving elements. Features include friendly NPCs who fight alongside the Chief, squad-based AI where enemies groups work together to flank you under the direction of a leader unit and can be demoralized by his death. They also use cover, set ambushes, etc.Only two weapons may be carried at a time: one active and one on backup.  There are five human weapons and three Covenant with distinct art styles for the two groups. Human weapons look basically like real guns and fire projectiles. Covenant are sleek and purple and fire energy. For the most part, weapons are not just left around the environment and must be procured from fallen enemies though there are supply points.Your life is armor and health as in most games of the genre, however, rather than armor being an item that is picked up, it is a force field which quickly recharges itself after several seconds without taking damage, which emphasizes finding cover.One of the most significant features is vehicles. You can drive a variety of vehicles in both single-player and multiplayer, some of which have additional seats for passengers or gunners which can be used by AI characters. Vehicles also come in distinct human and Covenant varieties with their design philosophies.  Human vehicles roll around the ground on wheels and covenant vehicles hover or fly.Halo also has a significant multiplayer component with basic deathmatch (called slayer here), capture the flag with the unusual addition that the flag takes your weapon spot while you are holding it, so shooting your way in and out of the base on your own is not an option, territories, and some options unique to the game, such as oddball, where you must hold onto a skull for the longest time, race where you score points by getting to checkpoints and juggernaut, where one super-powered player must get points by killing the others and the other players try to kill him to steal his powers. There is also a game editor which allows you to set custom rules for all the basic game types. All the playable weapons and vehicles from the campaign mode are available in the multiplayer maps with the ability for members of the same team to share the game's distinctive Warthog vehicle, which is essentially a small truck with a mounted gun on the back.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Kabuki Warriors</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2001-11-15</td><td>Crave Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>LightWeight Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td>Martial arts</td><td>Fighting</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Kabuki Warriors is a sword-fighting samurai game where you travel from city to city to fight enemy Kabuki teams.

The last of the Gabbits is captures by two Vykkers, owners of Vykkers Labs, where they conduct experiments on living creatures. The two implant a sonar device in Munch's head, concocting a plan to enslave him and use him to trap other animals. However, Munch discovers that the implant has given him new powers; using those, he begins to free the vicious Fuzzles, whom the Vykkers have been using in their laboratories, hoping to escape himself and help other creatures who suffer under the yoke of the Glukkons.Munch's Oddysee is set in the fictional Oddworld universe; its events take place after those of Abe's Exoddus. The player controls Munch as well as Abe, the hero of the previous Oddworld games. Abe's abilities haven't changed much since the last installment: as before, GameSpeak must be used to communicate with other creatures, leading them to safety. His fellow Mudokons can now be ordered to attack enemies. Abe can also grab and toss Mudokons or Munch to lead them to area they cannot access otherwise. Possessing enemies also comes into play, and is needed to solve many of the puzzles. Possession abilities can now be used to ignite quarrels between enemies and make them fight each other. The player can change between Abe and Munch instantly throughout most of the game. Munch brings on the table new abilities of his own: he can use his sonar to control or immobilize specific creatures, as well as swim. Another new addition is the possibility to use vending machines, which sell various items that enhance the abilities of the protagonists. At certain points Abe and Munch can also remote-control mechanical creatures.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Project Gotham Racing</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2001-11-15</td><td>Microsoft Corporation</td><td>Bizarre Creations, Ltd.</td><td>Racing / Driving</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Automobile, Street racing, Track racing</td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Project Gotham Racing takes you and your car onto the streets at night, where there are people to impress with your driving ability.

Tricky features far more storytelling than the original through the use of personality attributes. Rivalries develop between characters with opposing attributes, causing them to act more aggressively towards each other during races. The übertrick system adds a whole new layer to the game. These tricks are much tougher to pull off, but give you a nice boost. Performing six übertricks in a row results in a super übertrick, which rewards you with a bigger boost and causes Run DMC's "It's Tricky" to play. Seven tracks return from the original accompanied by brand-new Garibaldi and Alaska tracks. The returning tracks contain up to four times as many shortcuts and hidden lines. Six of the eight riders from the original return (Jurgen and Hiro suffered off-season injuries) and are joined by six new ones. The soundtrack will feature mixes by Mix Master Mike, Aphrodite, and the Plump DJs.

On one terrible day, his wife and newborn daughter were killed by three junkies, who broke into his apartment after having ingested a new designer drug known as Valkyr. After the tragedy, Max quit the police force and joined the Drug Enforcement Administration. Three years later, during a raid on a mafia compound that was reportedly trafficking Valkyr, his best friend and fellow DEA agent Alex is killed, and he becomes the prime suspect in his murder. Now Max is all alone in the cold, snowy night of New York. The mob is out to get him. The police are out to get him. The only way out is with guns blazing, because he has nothing to lose.Max Payne is a third person shooter stylistically influenced by film noir, "hardboiled" detective stories, and Hong-Kong action cinema. Max can perform rolls and leaps to try and dodge enemy fire. The weapons at his disposal range from baseball bats to Ingram sub-machine guns, grenades, Molotov cocktails, and others. A unique feature of the game is the usage of the so-called Bullet Time - a time-slowing ability that was popularized by the first  Matrix movie. Activating the Bullet Time slows down everything that happens around Max (including his own movements), allowing for slow, but precise performance of moves to take care of his enemies. A special meter indicates how much time the effect will last, and how long Max needs to wait until it can be activated again.Cutscenes in the game are presented as comic book-style graphical panels accompanied by voice-overs. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Star Wars: Starfighter</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2001-12-18</td><td>LucasArts Entertainment Company LLC</td><td>LucasArts Entertainment Company LLC</td><td>Action, Simulation</td><td>Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td>Space flight</td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Based on the events of Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, there are three main characters: Rhys Dallows, Vana Sage, and Nym, each with their own perspectives on the events surrounding the battle for Naboo.

While the last two are still as important, the player must pace according to the stamina of the racer. While it can be partially replenished using water bottles, to win races the player must use downward slopes to gain velocity while still recovering stamina as well as taking advantage of the slipstream of other riders. While losing all stamina won't immediately abort the race, the rider will stop and put a feet down until it recovers to an acceptable level, making any chance of a good result impossible.

Fighting across Nosgoth, his goal is to make his way to the great city of Meridian and take control of this stronghold. However, upon reaching the gates of the city, the army is challenged by the Serafan Order, an organized force of vampire hunters and its leader, the magical Serafan lord. Kain engages the Serafan lord in single combat, is struck down and defeated. Kain's sword, the Soul Reaver, is claimed by his enemy. Unconscious for 200 years, Kain awakes under the care of the vampire Umah to a world he barely recognizes. Following the defeat of Kain's army, the vampires have been hunted down by the Serafan and only a few remain. The city of Meridian is ruled under martial law by the Serafan Order, which is very oppressive towards its citizens. Strange glyph magic is used to power machines and fuel industry and at the same time is deadly to vampires and used as wards throughout the city. Kain swears revenge on the one who defeated him and seeks to reclaim his place as the ruler of the vampires.The Legacy of Kain Series: Blood Omen 2 is a third person action game with adventure elements, more similar in perspective to Soul Reaver than the first Blood Omen game. The player views the environment from behind Kain's shoulder, moving him in different directions, attacking, jumping, using dark gifts, and grabbing on to ledges. Kain's life energy steadily depletes and must be replenished constantly by drinking blood. Blood is found by consuming any living creature nearby, often requiring defeating an enemy through combat first. As Kain consumes blood, his meter is filled up. Once full, Kain gains additional health. Kain also learns new dark gifts throughout the game by defeating boss creatures. Some gifts include: the ability to blend into mist, fire projectiles, use projectile telekinesis or make a great horizontal leap. Many of these abilities can be used to perform stealth kills which will instantly defeat a foe. Kain will fight using his bare hands or by picking up daggers, swords, axes, and other weapons. These weapons all attack differently, eventually breaking, and may also be thrown at enemies from afar.The Serafan Order uses glyph magic, partially because it is deadly to vampires. Kain will often encounter areas where he is barred from progressing because of glyph barriers and must find a way around them. Additionally, glyphs function similar to electricity in that they power machines and switches. Many of the puzzles featured in Blood Omen 2 involve needing to create a glyph circuit in order to deliver power to a specific point. Glyph energy glows as it travels down its path, allowing the player to see exactly where the energy spark is.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">F1 2002</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-03-22</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Visual Sciences Ltd.</td><td>Racing / Driving, Simulation</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td>Oceania</td><td>Automobile, Track racing</td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td></td><td>Released</td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Every track, driver, team, and pit crew from the official F1 2002 competition are included in this, the '02 version of the long-standing EA F1 series.Drive in a full season, a single race, test sessions (where you can modify your car's setup to increase your cars speed, handling, etc and test them under normal racing conditions) and training, where you can learn the basics and more advanced areas of Formula 1 racing.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">007: Agent Under Fire</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-03-25</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Electronic Arts Canada, Electronic Arts Redwood Shores Studio</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person</td><td>Licensed</td><td>Spy / espionage</td><td>Shooter</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">007: Agent Under Fire is the first James Bond game to appear on the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox.

The basic gameplay is as ever - take control of a football team (literally thousands are offered, from 26 leagues) and aim to make them the best in the country and then the world.Your players are depicted via a huge selection of statistics, covering their abilities, histories and performances (in each match they are rated out of 10; average ratings to 2 decimal places are among the stats saved for every one of the 30 seasons you can play for). A huge number of preset tactics are available, and each player's individual role can be customised for each area of the field. The transfer system allows you to scout for players all over the world and sign them permanently or on loan, with other clubs trying to do the same, and bidding for your players. You choose training schedules for each player, and watch their performance change as a result.As well as updating the player and team data to account for transfers and promotions / relegations, a number of new features are included in the game.

As with all the Gauntlet games, you play a medieval fantasy character who, along with allies if you have them, fights his or her way through hordes of evil creatures on the never-ending quest for more gold and perhaps even an eventual goal. This version contains the characters and levels from Gauntlet: Legends, plus the new characters and levels from the Dark Legacy arcade game, with a few extra levels thrown in.There are eight characters to initially choose from: the mighty Warrior, the deadly Valkyrie, the quick-footed Archer, the powerful Wizard, the spellcasting Sorceress, the stalwart Knight, the valiant Dwarf, and the chaotic Jester. Although there are similarities between characters from the two games, each character looks and plays differently. In addition, there are eight alternative-modes for these characters to unlock, plus dozens of secret characters to obtain. With a multi-tap, up to four players can play, with rules governing how much they can hurt each other. Unlike the original Gauntlets, the levels you'll face take place in various terrain from forests to mountains to volcanic plains. Many of the monsters are familiar to old fans of the series, but there is some new blood among the ranks of evil, including some rather large foes. Unlike the early Gauntlet arcade games, the camera angle varies from location to location, from bird's eye to nearly ground level. The lands, creatures, and heroes are all rendered in 3D. While the graphics have been upgraded, the gameplay is very similar. You basically run around levels, hacking at what seems like unlimited armies of monsters, searching for gold, keys, and health-giving food...as well as a way out of the level. Bosses and other scripted events slow down the repetitious nature of the originals.While levels can be gained and characters saved, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy is an action game with some RPG trappings and should not be confused with the more true types from that genre.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-04-26</td><td>Universal Interactive Inc.</td><td>Traveller's Tales (UK) Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Regional differences</td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex is the first Crash Bandicoot game for a system other than the original PlayStation.

For this purpose, he creates Crunch, a super-bandicoot who can destroy everything that crosses his way. Crunch's power source is a set of magical masks known as the Elementals, each representing a different element, including Earth, Water, Fire, and Ice. The warp room splits levels into their respective elements, with the boss of each section being a battle against Crunch influenced by the Elemental mask of said section. The game is a typical jump and run, with some other action passages, like air combat and a sequence where Crash is trapped inside a giant sphere rolling around in some sort of rollercoaster. All graphics are in 3D, and the sound is typical for cartoon games like this. The whole game is pretty straightforward in design, getting stuck on a puzzle is not really possible.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Burnout</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-04-30</td><td>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Criterion Software Ltd.</td><td>Action, Racing / Driving</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Automobile, Street racing, Track racing</td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Burnout is an arcade style racing game in the mold of the Test Drive or Need For Speed series.

Your job is to simply race from point to point in the fastest time possible.  The key to success in Smashing Drive lies in two features:  crazy power-ups and hidden shortcuts.  Almost all of the power-ups transform your taxi in some way that allows you to smash your way through traffic with ease.

It includes both national and club teams (from England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain), plus the ability to create custom teams,  with details ranging from the usual name, strips and colours to the stadium. Other than Beckham himself, no player is licensed (likeness is preserved, but names are replaced with phonetic equivalents, such as “Owin” or “Zanetee”), but the editor also allows the player to customize each player and team.
Game modes include friendly, club season, several international cups (including the defunct Home Championship), Classic Matches (some featuring the highlights of Beckham's career, others just classic matches), Beat Brazil, where the player starts with France, and tries to beat Brazil with a progressively weaker team, Survival, where the player face top international teams, with goals against carrying over, until the player loses a match, and Train With Beckham, a series of  drill minigames destined to teach the basics of the game and unlock “secrets”. Gameplay is similar to previous titles developed by the company (most notably Microsoft Football 2000 and UEFA Striker), and not unlike Beckham, has its strong point during dead ball situations, where the player can choose either to use a set play to get the defense offguard, or take a direct shot or swerving pass using the traditional arrow indicator.
In terms of options, the game doesn’t offer much to tweak, only bookings, offsides, injuries, match length and the decider (simple or golden goal overtime and penalty shootout)</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-06-07</td><td>Bethesda Softworks LLC</td><td>Bethesda Game Studios</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Action RPG, Sandbox / open world</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Freed by the decree of Uriel Septim VII, the Emperor of Tamriel, a lone prisoner is transported to the province of Morrowind. It seems that the strange dreams this prisoner has been having lately may have a connection to equally strange events occurring there. The protagonist is given a simple assignment: join the Blades, a secret organization whose goal is to protect the safety of the Emperor. This leads to a discovery of an ancient prophecy and an evil scheme concocted by a powerful deity whom the protagonist alone is able to stop.Conceived in the tradition of the Elder Scrolls series, Morrowind is a fantasy role-playing game with a vast world open for exploration. After being released from a prison ship at the shores of the island Vvardenfell, the protagonist may do more or less what he or she wants: follow the main quest and solve the mystery of an ancient prophecy, join any of roughly a dozen guilds and rise in their hierarchy by performing duties, or simply explore the gigantic island with its stylistically diverse cities, hundreds of dungeons and tombs, ancient ruins and mighty fortresses. Morrowind uses a two-stage skill system. The hero’s primary stats (strength etc.) increase with each level gained, while secondary abilities improve by use – for example, the more often the character jumps, the more proficient he or she becomes in the Acrobatics skill, etc. The action-oriented fights are simple exchanges of strikes or spells, until one combatant dies. The enemy's hit points and condition were not originally shown; however, at the request of customers a health bar was added for enemies as part of the first upgrade patch.The protagonist's race and gender, but also his or her reputation influence the reactions of NPCs. If a character’s sympathy for the hero is low (rated on a scale from 1 to 100), he might refuse to answer questions; if it is high, the player will get more detailed information and better bargains in shops. Most quests involving other persons can be solved by persuasion, pick-pocketing, or simply by force.The game's NDL 3D game engine is powerful in drawing wide, detailed outdoor landscapes as well as complex indoor environments. Transitions are not fluent; houses and dungeons must be loaded upon entering. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Outlaw Golf</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-06-12</td><td>Simon & Schuster Interactive</td><td>Hypnotix, Inc.</td><td>Action, Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td>Fighting</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The first game in the Outlaw series of sports titles, Outlaw Golf is what you get when you take the classic game of golf and throw in lesbian strippers, wannabe rappers, ex cons and other wild personalities.  The game has a bad attitude chock full of sexual themes and language that puts Happy Gilmore to shame.Outlaw Golf pits you as one of ten over-the-top golfing personalities (paired with equally over-the-top caddies) to compete in over 30 different tour events from where you attempt to unlock new characters, better clubs and balls as well as improving your golfer's skills along the way with 12 different mini-games.  The game also sports a composure response system, which simply means that when you do well, the game is easier and when you aren't doing so well you will find your shots not going exactly where you want them. Composure too low? Beat up your caddy and you can relieve some of that stress to regain your lost composure. Multiplayer supports 8 different game modes, including stroke play, match play, skins, best ball and casino with up to four players.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Cupid Bistro!!</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-06-13</td><td>Success Corp.</td><td>Firedog Computer Entertainment Ltd.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG), Simulation</td><td>1st-person, Side view, Top-down</td><td></td><td>Romance</td><td>Managerial / business simulation, Visual novel</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td>Menu structures</td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td>2D scrolling, Fixed / flip-screen, Isometric</td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Taking place in a fantasy cooking world, Cupid Bistro asks: what really is the difference between cooking and alchemy? The answer, apparently, is very little; in this world, cooking delicious meals can produce fantastical effects and grant magical powers to their eaters. The player takes on the role of a restauranteur with the dream of becoming a Master Chef - the world's most powerful magical chef.Gameplay combines business management with RPG adventuring and visual novel storytelling. In the restaurant mode, players view their restaurant from an isometric layout; they're able to customize the layout as they please while choosing what to make. Players can also research new original dishes, or even expand their empire with extra floors or new restaurants entirely. Players can also venture out of the restaurant itself into town, where they can engage in dialogue with other characters or go shopping for restaurant supplies. Characters they meet can become workers in the player's restaurant and, if their relationship is good enough, they can even participate in research to come up with unique new dishes.In the adventure mode, players can explore the wilderness with up to two allies while bringing their best magical food with them to support them in battle. Defeating enemies not only grants experience points, it also grants money and special items that can't be bought in the city. Players can also romance any of twelve different female characters, with unique plot branches and endings based on their choices.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Splashdown</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-06-15</td><td>Infogrames, Inc.</td><td>Rainbow Studios, Inc.</td><td>Racing / Driving, Sports</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Splashdown puts the player in the role of one of nine "over the top" jetskiiers, and challenges the player to race on a plethora of courses.Most courses take place in lakes and rivers, all modified to include jumps.

Tracks take place in different areas of the world, from Florida to Italy.Each character has a different seadoo, that has it's own unique characteristics, such as handling, speed and acceleration.  Each seadoo has been licensed by the SEA-DOO company, so each machine is accurate in its looks and ability.Each rider can perform a number of different stunts, such as the Superman, the Can-Can, and the Lazyboy.

This game features full size teams and plays much like a real soccer title until you dropkick one of your opponents to the ground.

Additionally to typical set of options for this type of game (i.e. clickable versus auto-scrolling text), Triangle Again offers positioning of the text messages (up or down) and also support regular and widescreen picture presentation.There are several licensed songs used in the game as protagonist's song hits when she sings them during animated scenes.

Dispensing with any pretence of simulation, the game aims for arcade gameplay. The bright colours in the art style and easy way the cars can be turned with just a press of the handbrake all signal that this is not a game to be taken seriously.Although cosmetically the damage is locational, the cars do not suffer unduly if the damage is taken all in one area. Unlike the Destruction Derby games, you can continue to use your front to ram opponents throughout a match. Rather than have the cars race laps, matches more often take place in open arenas of sand, ice, grass, mud and tarmac.Multiplayer comes with different game modes. Traditional Last Man Standing is supplemented with multiple variations. A Hunter game-type, where one car is designated a target and points can only be scored by hitting it. There is also a score target which encourages going for the big points hits and stunts, rather than destroying competitors. Others are defensive and offensive driving challenges and a game type where only points scored by performing jumps and stunts are counted. Multiplayer is supported through 4-player split-screen, but no through Xbox Live play or the system link.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Bruce Lee: Quest of the Dragon</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-07-02</td><td>Universal Interactive Inc.</td><td>Ronin Entertainment</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td>Martial arts</td><td>Beat 'em up / brawler</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Bruce Lee: Quest of the Dragon features an epic storyline in which Bruce battles multiple enemies to rescue his kidnapped father and retrieve the mystical Golden Relic.

There are two game modes: a single-player/cooperative campaign and multiplayer deathmatch mode, supporting up to four players. The game takes place in an arena. Four different color balls of magic energy float around randomly in the arena, and can be picked up and fired at your foes. By holding down the fire button you can control how far the ball shoots. The balls do no damage until the end of their travel, at which point they explode, damaging whatever is beneath them.You can pick up in total four balls of energy to orbit your character before you can pick up no more. If you collect all of one color, then this charges up your blast to be much more powerful than simply your regular fired ball. For example, a full four blue water magics will cause a stream of water to be released at the end of your shot, flowing down the screen from that point through all walls and obstacles and hitting everything underneath its path. If you collect one of each color, then this will cause you to release an 8-way explosion of regular shots careening randomly in every direction. There's also chests scattered randomly around the battlefield, and inside are various power-ups (as well as power-downs) that affect your character in various ways: speed boost, homing shots, guided shots, etc.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Crazy Taxi 3: High Roller</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-07-24</td><td>SEGA of America, Inc.</td><td>Hitmaker</td><td>Racing / Driving</td><td>3rd-person (Other), Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade</td><td></td><td>Automobile, Vehicle simulator</td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Crazy Taxi 3 serves up more of the classic gameplay that made the series so popular on the Dreamcast.

Training: for exploration and practice of the racecourse and setting personal records;
Race: up to four different characters race each other over several rounds with the first one crossing the finish line winning;
Popolopoï: one must reach the finish line before time runs out. Time can be replenished by shooting some kind of butterflies called Popolopoï and no opponents are to be beaten;
Lums: over three laps, a certain amount of Lums have to be collected  and one must beat the other opponents to the finish line.
The arena battle mode is split in three different battle types:
Lum Spring: the first to collect five Lums/crystals or the one with the most Lums when time runs out wins. Ice bullets can be fired at an opponent to temporarily freeze them and beat them to the Lum;
Lum Fight: all players start with five hit points each that need to be shot off with weapons found around the arena. A point is scored if a player shoots off the last hit point of another player. The first to reach a certain amount of points or the one with the most points when time runs out wins. When killed through one’s own actions, a negative point is scored;
Capture the Fly: the goal is to find and capture a Light-Fly. The fly follows you around and gives you a point when a certain amount of time has passed. One loses control of the fly when hit by an opponent's bullet. The first to reach a certain amount of points or the one with the most points when time runs out wins.
Playable characters include:

Team members can be sent orders (attack, retreat, follow, stay, ...) or controlled individually. On the team is Bradley, the team leader, Conners, the heavy weapons man, Jones, the explosives and anti-tank expert, and Foley, the team sniper.

In some missions, the player drives tanks or jeeps around while other squad members man the guns on the vehicle.

One who sought hegemony. One who sought ambition. One who stood up for righteousness. Veterans who shared the same swarmed under each leader.  These stalwart souls waged war across the vast expanse of the land and, like blood thirsty demons, cut down any and all who stood in their way.They followed their own rules, they were both revered and feared by millions... they are the Dynasty Warriors.Dynasty Warriors 3 takes place over the 50 years of war recounted in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, from the first flames of battle in the Yellow Turban Rebellion to the final battle between Wei and Shu on the plains of Wu Zhong. Over 40 characters are playable, both from the three main sides as well as leaders of lesser armies along the way. Each character that belongs to either Wu, Wei, or Shu has their own series of levels where they will turn the tide of battle for their force to win. Each character has their own unique weapon type and magic ability, although they can share weaker variations of weapons with other characters who use the same style of weapon. Weapons and items are dropped randomly from boxes in levels as well as from defeated enemy generals, and each has a range of stats dependent on the difficulty level and the strength of the general. The most powerful weapons and items, however, can only be collected by completing hidden objectives as each character. Characters grow more powerful by collecting stat up items from defeated generals, and doing well in levels rewards points that level up the bodyguards who follow the player character.Most completed levels can be replayed with any character and any side in free mode. An encyclopedia is included as well that details every event and character from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, even those that never appear in Dynasty Warriors 3.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">NBA Starting Five</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-10-01</td><td>Konami of America, Inc.</td><td>Konami Computer Entertainment Osaka Co., Ltd.</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">NBA Starting Five is an NBA-licensed basketball game, and a follow-up to Konami's earlier NBA 2Night games.Included players and teams are based on the 2002-2003 season.

But he is tricked into returning to his trade when his friend, a priest, gets kidnapped by an Italian mafioso. 
Hitman 2: Silent Assassin is a third-person stealth game. As a titular hitman, you have to complete a number of missions all over the world. Each mission generally involves assassinating someone and possibly fulfilling a couple of other objectives. Typically, your target will be protected by numerous guards. While there's a large arsenal of weapons available to you - ranging from stealthy weapons such as a garrote or a silenced pistol, up to machine guns and sniper rifles - your main weapon will be stealth. Agent 47 can sneak around to remain undetected, and he can disguise himself in clothes from killed or stunned guards. The guards aren't completely stupid, however, as they will investigate suspicious noises, and they'll react if they see you waving around a gun. They'll get suspicious if they see you running around, raise alarm upon finding a corpse, and if you hang in a disguise around them too long, they'll eventually realize you're not one of their buddies. Hitman 2: Silent Assassin brings something new to the series: depending on your stealthiness, you are given a rating upon completing a mission. Going trigger-happy on everyone will result in being called a "Mass Murderer", while only the most patient and skilled players will manage to receive the "Silent Assassin" rating, which generally involves stealthily eliminating the target without raising any suspicion. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">NHL 2003</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-10-02</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Electronic Arts Canada</td><td>Sports</td><td>Behind view, Diagonal-down, Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Managerial / business simulation</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This year's edition features many different modes of gameplay for the NHL enthusiast.

It is these things that the Brimstone Society hunts, and their newest agent for the cause is the half-vampire codenamed BloodRayne. Her mission will take her from clearing out the walking dead and man-sized insects in the swamps of Louisiana to hunting down members of the secretive Gegengheist Gruppe branch of the Nazi military around the world, as well as the monsters they unwittingly awakened.Rayne's primary weapons against both monsters and men are the blades attached to her arms, and as the game progresses she will gain additional attacks to string together. Rayne can also hold many weapons, such as pistols, shotguns, and submachine guns, at once, but she is not overly attached to them and will discard any weapon that runs dry. Her enhanced vampiric strength even allows her to rip up mounted gun emplacements and fire them from the hip. Another vampiric strength is her ability to drain the blood out of any human she can grab in order to restore her health. By killing enemies Rayne's rage meter will fill, eventually allowing her to enter Blood Rage, slowing the world around her and gaining new combo attacks that can dismember or totally cut in half weaker opponents. Rayne's ability to perceive the world will grow as the game progresses as well, allowing her to see living things through walls, zoom in on distant targets, and speed up her perception that everything, herself included, appears to slow down.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">NBA Inside Drive 2003</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-10-15</td><td>Microsoft Game Studios</td><td>High Voltage Software, Inc.</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">NBA Inside Drive 2003 offers intense gameplay, lively commentary, detailed arenas from the NBA, and music by MasterP.

Using the paradoxes of time travel to his advantage, the hero can regularly join up with past and future versions of himself, to fight the enemy as a team. A wide selection of historical, modern, and futuristic weapons is available, and environments feature destructible elements.Depending on the difficulty level chosen, players will find themselves with rudimentary objectives to complete or, on the harder settings, new areas and substantially more involved objectives to fulfill. Two players can also play the Story mode cooperatively and simultaneously.Like its predecessor, TimeSplitters 2 features a Challenge mode, which presents the player with a selection of time- and skill-based events. Completing these within the predetermined constraints awards the player with bronze, silver, or gold medals, which in turn aid in unlocking additional game options, levels, and playable characters (of which there are more than 120).The Arcade mode offers League, Custom, and Network sub-modes. League events feature pre-configured maps, game types, and objectives for the player to compete in, while the other Arcade modes make up the bulk of the multiplayer portion of the title. In the Custom mode, up to four players and numerous AI "bots" can compete in 16 different customizable disciplines including Deathmatch, Regeneration, Virus, Thief, Shrink, Monkey Assistant, and Flame Tag -- each offering an altered form of gameplay. Thief, for example, tasks players with collecting tokens left behind by fallen combatants. Here, the tokens determine the winner, not the number of kills.

After a futile search for Lan Di in Yokosuka, Ryo is contacted by Chen Yao Wen, a Chinese master who advises him to travel to Hong-Kong and seek out Master Lishao Tao, who might be the only one who knows what had happened between Lan Di and Ryo's father in the past. Ryo arrives in Hong Kong and starts searching for a man who is his only link to the elusive murderer.Shenmue II is a direct sequel to Shenmue, continuing its story. The game's structure and basic gameplay elements are similar to those of the first game, incorporating elements of adventure, fighting, and light role-playing within a life simulation experience. Ryo explores vast 3D environments, talks to people to gather clues, and occasionally participates in fighting sequences. Like in the previous game, Ryo can train to become stronger in battles, and gradually learns new moves, which constitutes the role-playing element of the game.The game's environments are based on real locations in Hong Kong. The game world is significantly larger than that of its predecessor. The game also has a somewhat more linear story progression with numerous precise objectives, though free-form exploration is available during most of the game. Earning money plays a more important role, and many objectives are built around Ryo having to take part-time jobs (most of which are shaped like action mini-games) or participate in fights to win money. Like in the first game, Ryo can visit the arcades and play exact replicas of older arcade games, e.g. OutRun.The sequel features a larger amount of characters who take part in the story. Some of them also accompany Ryo on his journey, helping him in fights or other dangerous situations. The game also noticeably increases the amount of quick-time events (QTEs). Several key sequences are composed entirely out of cutscenes during which the player has to rapidly press combinations of buttons in order to execute the correct action. Many major fights in the game also include extensive QTE segments, often serving as a culmination of the fight.The Xbox version of the game comes with an additional DVD called Shenmue: The Movie, which contains a summation of the first Shenmue made into a feature-length movie. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">WTA Tour Tennis</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2002-10-30</td><td>Konami of Europe GmbH</td><td>Konami Computer Entertainment Osaka Co., Ltd.</td><td>Sports</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Back of Case - XBOX (US) (from Ad Blurbs)Play with The Pros!

Suddenly, a tremendous blow darkens the sight of his eyes, and the next thing he can see is a very strange room filled with bizarre objects, and a voice talking to him from nowhere. A mysterious being known as Homunculus tells Eike that he has been stabbed to death. Homunculus gives Eike a time-travelling device and brings him back to life a short while before his murder took place. From that moment on, Eike's miraculously acquired second chance turns into a constant race against time, as he tries to escape from his destiny. In order to alter the course of events, preventing the unknown person from carrying out his murder, Eike will have to travel back in time as far as the 16th century, meeting people closely connected to his own existence and changing the fabric of reality.Shadow of Memories (Shadow of Destiny in North America) is an adventure game. There are no action elements in the game, and the protagonist has no health bar. Each chapter has a time limit, during which Eike has to find a way to prevent the murderer from killing him. This is mainly achieved by traveling through time to different hours, days, years, and even centuries. Obtaining a crucial item, having a conversation with a specific character, or performing another action in the past will prevent Eike from getting killed. Time-traveling requires energy units, which can be found by exploring the town.

The player takes on the role of Sam Fisher, an operative for the secret organization NSA Black Operation, part of the U.S. government. The organization deals with very sensitive missions, often taken on by a Third Echelon splinter cell division Fisher is part of.  His missions are so discreet, that if he is captured the government will deny any such existence of that organization.To get around and reach his objectives, Fisher has a variety of moves at his disposal. He can walk, run, crouch, jump, rappel, shimmy, cross horizontal wires, zip using a zip cord, and do a split jump. There are different approaches to taking out enemies. He can use weapons, but the noise might alert guards and that generally makes it more difficult to complete missions. Opponents can be stunned, killed, or subdued. Fisher can for instance jump down from the ceiling and knock an opponent unconscious. Some enemies are needed to activate a door or passcode. Therefore enemies can be taken hostage by holding a gun to their head. They can also be interrogated or be used as human shields.Other features include the ability to peak through a door before going through or use an optic cable camera (a "snake" camera) to peer through the underside, to check what is ahead. As the focus is on stealth, the amount of weapons is rather small. There is an FN F2000 assault rifle that can be fitted with a silencer and other modifications, and there is a suppressed FN Five-Seven pistol. Ammo is limited and additional bullets are scarce. Players are encouraged to avoid danger by sneaking through shadows and hiding behind objects. Fisher has access to a light meter to check how visible he is, and night vision as well as thermal goggles to see in the dark and view warmer temperatures in colour. Other weapons are ring airfoil projectiles, gas grenades and sticky shockers.The Xbox version is the original one, with a closely adapted version for the PC, and separate ports for PS2 and GameCube.

The game is divided into several worlds, each divided into a couple of levels; the game is saved automatically after each level. In between the worlds, the player has to complete a mini-game where he has to surf along light-beams in a psychedelic environment. Rayman can also come across power-ups which temporarily give him a special power: the green power-up allows him to shoot tornadoes, the blue power-up gives him the ability to use a grappling hook, the yellow power-up allows him to fly for a short while, the orange power-up allows him to shoot precisely guided missiles and the red power-up grants him a very powerful fist that can bash doors. These power-ups are always necessary to defeat an enemy or a boss, or to get to the next part of the level. Rayman can find and free the Teensies locked in cages throughout the level; the freed Teensies will express their gratitude by opening up the next part of the map or by summoning some bonuses to collect. Each six Teensies freed increases Rayman's health bar. There are numerous bonuses hidden throughout the levels; completing the levels with lots of score will unlock humorous animations and mini-games.

This is the idea behind Burnout 2, which brings new modes and higher speeds compared to the original title. As usual, the aim is to speed around real-life roadways, through the traffic ahead, while avoiding collisions. Burnout is a street racing game focused around speed and crashing.  Unlike many games that focus on closed course driving, you get to drive through cities with real traffic and city infrastructure.  Designers have built city districts and surrounding areas and implemented the racecourses throughout the streets.  As a result, many times certain parts of race-courses interlace with other parts of other races.  As well, instead of encouraging strategic driving and safe driving, Burnout strongly encourages offensive driving.  Driving on the wrong side of the road, barely missing passing traffic, drifting, and jumps all add to your boost "burnout" meter.  Speed boosts and jumps aid your attempt to drive past buses, trucks, and anything else that gets in the way.  The more offensive and dangerous your driving is, the more boost you get!Burnout 2 contains a full campaign and custom car campaign.  While you can unlock regular cars and tracks, later in the campaign you unlock more raceways like reverse tracks and one-way sprints.  You can unlock over 20 cars like a Nascar, a 1920s gangster car, a Japanese muscle, and many customized vehicles with custom paint jobs and upgraded stats.  Along with the same sense of speed and highly detailed crash animations as before, Point of Impact includes new modes of play.  Pursuit mode has you playing the cop as you chase down the speeding motorists, and to win you must crash them out of the race.  Or you can reverse that with a friend.  You can flee from a friend while he attempts to chase you.  Crash mode, as the name suggests, forces you to glide into crowded intersections to get the most cars involved in a pile-up as possible.  The bigger the crash, the better.  Up to 4 players can compete for the best score.Training and 2 player racing modes are also included.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Tides of War</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-05-06</td><td>Activision Publishing, Inc.</td><td>Gray Matter Interactive Studios, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td>Fantasy, Sci-fi / futuristic, World War II</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Tides of War is an updated re-release for the Xbox based on the original PC version Return to Castle Wolfenstein.

It is said that the former was successfully defeated by the Jedi, and that Darth Malak betrayed his mentor and is planning to take on the Republic by himself. His aggression is so successful that some Jedi have decided to join his ranks. A seemingly ordinary soldier of the Republic is traveling aboard a space ship that is attacked by Darth Malak's minions. Narrowly escaping, the soldier meets a female Jedi named Bastila, one of those who have fought Darth Revan in the decisive battle. With her help, the soldier must learn to become a Jedi, stop Darth Malak, and discover the truth about his or her own past.Knights of the Old Republic is a role-playing game that uses the Star Wars D20 rule system, which is similar to the 3rd Edition of Dungeons & Dragons. Character development and combat are handled similarly to BioWare's previous RPGs such as Baldur's Gate series. Combat engine follows similar "real-time with pause" rules. There are only three active combatants on the player's side (as opposed to six in Baldur's Gate). Several characters join the party and can be switched at the player's will.Eventually, the protagonist will have to train at the Jedi academy to earn a lightsaber and force moves. Force powers include stun, force pull (which pulls opponents or objects toward the player-controlled character), the Jedi Mind Trick, which persuades people to see things the player's way, and many others. The player has various weapons at his or her disposal, from the lightsaber to blasters, grenades, ion rifles, etc. Throughout the game, the player will visit many Star Wars locations that appeared in the movies, such as Kashyyyk, the homeworld of the Wookiees,  the desert planet of Tatooine, and others. Interacting with characters in various ways and performing side quests influences the protagonist's stand with the forces of Light and Darkness. The player can turn the main character into a flawless Jedi, a ruthless Sith, or anything in between. Some of the player's choices influence major events that occur within the storyline.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">NCAA Football 2004</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-07-16</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>EA Tiburon</td><td>Sports</td><td></td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Managerial / business simulation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">NCAA Football 2004 is another entry in EA Sports' NCAA Football series.

It is set in the 29th century where a substance named Multiplast replaces all known construction materials because it can be formed into anything. But something is wrong on the planet Proteus, the only known source of Multiplast. Now the simple worker Nevin has to investigate and stop the megalomaniac shape shifter Paavo who controls an even more powerful substance.Luckily soon after the beginning of the game Nevin gets his hands on a special suit, which allows him to morph into three forms. The sword form is for melee combat, in which combos can be triggered by using the correct button combinations. The cannon form is a big robot which is more suited for gunplay and the stealth form is a futuristic lizard with a long tongue. During combat the player can instantly switch between the forms, which allows for many combinations depending on the former action or movement. This gets rewarded with plasma points which are used to upgrade Nevin's life energy, new moves or better weapons.Besides combat, the game features basic switch puzzles and rhythm-based mini games. Most notable is the Time Dilation Mode, which can be activated near enemies - then the mini game begins and, if successfully completed, launches an especially powerful attack.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Chaos Bleeds</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-08-26</td><td>Vivendi Universal Games, Inc.</td><td>Eurocom Developments Ltd</td><td>Action</td><td>Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td>Horror</td><td>Puzzle elements</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Buffy and the crew are back for another battle against evil.

What they encounter is something they never would've thought of.As Patrick, the leader of SOAR, you are tasked with exploring the ship, putting the pieces together, and rescuing any survivors you can find. The ship you are on, the Ozymandias, is a dynamically changing structure, which enables you to move hallways and re-position doors so that you can access new areas all the time.During your search, you'll have to battle a number of various dinosaurs, from Raptors to the terrible Tyrannosauras Rex.  Luckily, you have a variety of weapons at your disposal, from standard firearms and shotguns to sophisticated laser and beam-guided rifles.  You may also find and use Wasps; little robotic bee-shaped critters that can attack enemies or open doors and other devices.To aid you, you are equipped with a jetpack that you can use at any time to hover or speed through areas.  It may also be used when in a tense firefight, taking the battle to the air.  Many dodging and evading techniques are possible with the use of the jetpack.Like the second game, Dino Crisis 2, you are awarded points for every dinosaur you kill.  Kill some in rapid succession, you'll earn more points and double them as well.  With enough points, you can buy new weapons, ammo, and health items at various terminal stations scattered throughout the ship.With the aid of three of your best crew, find the survivors, figure out what the hell happened, and most importantly, get off the ship before you become dino dinner.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">NHL 2004</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-09-22</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Electronic Arts Black Box</td><td>Sports</td><td>Behind view, Diagonal-down, Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Managerial / business simulation</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The "best selling pro hockey franchise" is back with the 2004 edition, and it's loaded with more.Like Madden NFL 2004, NHL 2004 has a deep career mode, titled Dynasty Mode.

For the 2004 sports season, Midway introduced a directive to move their sports titles away from over-the-top arcade-style gameplay, and introduce a more sim-like approach to sports. For NHL Hitz Pro, this meant moving away from 3-on-3 hockey to 5-on-5 hockey gameplay to make the game more authentic for the demands of the sim hockey player. While NHL Hitz Pro still maintains many of the arcade-style elements that were a signature feature of the Hitz series such as checks over the boards and hits through glass, the gameplay has been tuned to provide an experience that is accurate to the sport of hockey. That being said, the player has extensive options for tuning the gameplay for either a fast-paced arcade experience, or a slower, more sim-like style of play.As with competing titles, Hitz Pro supports a franchise mode, season and exhibition gameplay and a game tutorial/practice mode. The title also sports a pickup hockey mode with several environments that are reminiscent of playing hockey in outdoor venues.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-09-22</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Electronic Arts Redwood Shores Studio</td><td>Sports</td><td>Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Tiger Woods is back for another round of golf in this edition of the series.

In a heated argument, he considered them to be traitors, causing a civil war to start.Several gameplay features were changed from the classic title such as the player being Robin Hood himself (instead of picking one of four pretenders), full 3D graphics, a plot included with the game and the goal being to be the first to reach and conquer King John's stronghold in Cornwall. To do so, the player must build an army large enough to hold enough shires, which generate money from taxes. This money can then be used to hire new troops (peasants, archers, footmen and the mighty knights and catapults) or pay King Richard's ransom, which allow to enlist loyalist knights.As with the original game, action occurs in a turn-based map of England where the player decides which actions to take: conquer a neighbouring shire with Little John's army and hire soldiers either for him or territory defense, raid a castle or caravan, build strongholds, hold tournaments or spy on the other lords using Maid Marian's contacts on the court. Each of the attacking actions bring a quick minigame to be played:The first mini-game that appears is the archery raid; in this mode, the player sees the action directly from Robin Hood's eyes while he lurks on a tree, the goal being to use Robin's trustworthy  bow and arrow to hit cavalry guards and the convoy as they pass by his spot. As some guards are also armed with a bow, Robin can also hide behind the log for cover.
If the player attacks a guarded territory, the game enters a strategic mode where the battle takes place on a three-lane field, and the goal is to vanquish the enemy defenses of force him to flee  by launching direct attacks on each lane.
Sword fighting pits the player against one or more opponents, depending on the setting. The goal is simple: slash everyone by throwing blows and dodge/parry the opponents' own. During raids there is also a timer that represents the time before sunrise - failing to escape before that or being killed results on Robin's imprisonment.
Battles are done on a real-time fashion, where both armies are placed on the far-sides of a multi-lane battlefield. The player chooses which lane to attack (or defend) and if successful, the opponent will lose enough units to flee or simply wait for their deaths.
Jousting in a tournament allows the player to fight for fame, and then for gold and land. To do so, after picking an opponent, he starts by building enough speed, and then slam the spear into the opponent, the goal being to knock him from his horse.
Some shires are protected by castles, and to conquer them, first a siege must be laid in. This requires the player to load up on catapults and then destroy each wall of the fortification by throwing boulders at it. Each wall represents a part of the defending army: the most damage done, the easier it becomes to invade it.Screenshots    Promo Images    Alternate Titles "侠盗罗宾汉：王冠守护者" -- Chinese spelling (simplified)

For those unfamiliar with the game, two seven-player teams of flying wizards attempt to score goals with one ball while dodging more flying balls and each other.  For those who are familiar with the game, you will be happy to know that the players, positions, and “strategies” of Quidditch are faithfully recreated.The game starts with a player selecting which of the four Hogwarts school teams he or she wishes to play for.  Following some tutorial events, they are launched into the competition for the Hogwarts Cup against the other three teams.  As the player wins games and completes specific challenges (such as “score 120 points in one game”) they collect Quidditch cards which unlock special combo moves.  Once a player has won the school championship, they can go on to play as one of nine international teams competing for the Quidditch World Cup each with its own style and special combo moves.  After winning the cup once, there are still more cards to be collected by playing and winning as different teams.People familiar with actual sports know that the rules of Quidditch (as described in Rowlings' books) are fundamentally flawed and that the only meaningful part of the game is the 1 on 1 competition between the two seekers trying to catch the golden snitch.  Quidditch World Cup alleviates this problem with the “golden snitch bar”.  As the game progresses, completing action combos and performing special moves adds to a team progress bar.  Eventually, when the snitch appears, the team with better positioning on the bar will start with an advantage in the chase.  Ironically, this system rewards things other than actual scoring so in-game goals still remain mostly meaningless (except on lower difficulty levels where it is very easy to build a 160+ point lead and make the snitch inconsequential).Because it is designed for younger audiences, Quidditch World Cup lacks most of the advanced features you would expect in an EA sports game (league play, team management, etc…).  It also lacks any multiplayer options other than two-player (same machine) exhibition matches</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Hunter: The Reckoning - Redeemer</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-10-28</td><td>Vivendi Universal Games, Inc.</td><td>High Voltage Software, Inc.</td><td>Action, Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td>Horror</td><td>Action RPG</td><td>Contemporary, Fantasy</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td>Real-time</td><td>Mature</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Hunter: The Reckoning - Redeemer takes place 10 years after the original Hunter: The Reckoning in the same sleepy town of Ashcroft.

Enter veteran international anti-terrorism unit Team Rainbow, who must stop the terrorists and discover who is behind the attacks.Rainbow Six 3 is an entry in the long-running series designed especially for consoles. It does away with the heavy strategy and planning elements the series was known for on the PC and offers an experience more focused on the first-person action. The game features 14 single-player levels (15 in the PS2 and GameCube versions). In each, the player controls Domingo 'Ding' Chavez, who leads a team of three other Rainbow operatives. Goals in each mission include taking out terrorists, defusing bombs and protecting hostages. Ding's squad mates will act on their own in supporting the mission, but they can also be given specific orders through a context-sensitive menu: holding position, advancing, clearing a room or defusing a bomb. It's also possible to give delayed orders which are only carried out once a special signal is given. The Xbox version features voice recognition: team orders can be given through a headset.Before each mission, each squad member must be equipped with a primary and secondary weapon plus further equipment. More than two dozen realistic firearms are available, and there are also different types of grenades (hand-thrown or fired through a launcher), charges and mines, as well as a gas mask. Thermal and night vision are always available and don't require special equipment.Despite the action focus, the game still opts for a certain amount of realism: there is no running or jumping, more than a few hits are fatal and there is no way to regain lost health.Besides the single player campaign, there is also the custom mission mode, which allows the player to hunt terrorists on unlocked maps from the campaign.The multiplayer modes include:

Cooperative campaign mode

However, Wanda Parks, the Chief of the E.O.D (Elite Operations Division), requires Nick's  assistance in a case that involves attacks on various venues in the Chinatown district. At first Nick is reluctant to help, preferring the vigilante life and focusing on avenging his father's death. However, he eventually agrees to conduct the investigation, on one condition: he must do it his way.True Crime: Streets of LA is a free-roaming driving and action game similar in concept to Grand Theft Auto III. The game's structure is mission-based; most of the missions are dictated by the story and initiate following a cutscene that advances it. Failing a mission still allows the player to continue playing through the chapter and undertake subsequent missions; in some cases this will lead to branching paths and optional missions. However, in order to complete the whole chapter the player must eventually succeed in all the main missions.Nick can hijack any car on the street (usually with little to no repercussions) and freely drive through the 240 square miles of Los Angeles. Nick is capable of firing his weapon when driving; in an open top vehicle, it is possible to aim anywhere. The player can also opt for exploring the city on foot. Nick will be frequently contacted by other police officers and informed about various street crimes. He can then fight perpetrators, arrest them, knock them unconscious, or kill them to deal with these crimes.The gameplay during the missions is separated into third-person shooting, fighting, and (more rarely) stealth sequences. All of these usually take place in relatively small, restricted environments. The shooting sequences involve Nick dealing with waves of enemies that appear in different places. Nick must react quickly, moving, crouching, or diving (with a "bullet time" effect) to avoid enemy attacks. A limited amount of painkillers can be found in such stages.During the fighting sequences, Nick utilizes his martial arts techniques to defeat enemies in hand-to-hand combat. Nick can punch, kick, grapple and throw enemies. The player can execute combos by pressing various combinations of buttons consecutively. It is also possible to pick up primitive melee weapons lying around, or take them from enemies. Both shooting and fighting stages have destructible environments.Stealth missions typically involve Nick traversing a hostile area without attracting the enemies' attention; the mission is failed if an enemy hasn't been dealt with silently, or shortly after he has discovered Nick. The player has the option of killing enemies or knocking them down; the latter awards the protagonist "good cop" points. Conversely, "bad cop" points are given to Nick for killing innocents or surrendered criminals. Depending on Nick's rating in these categories, the storyline branches during later chapters, leading to different endings.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-11-05</td><td>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Acclaim Studios Manchester</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Regional differences</td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance is an action game that takes place in the times of the Roman empire. You take control of Invictus Thrax, a Roman slave, who ascended through the ranks to become champion of all gladiators. Favored by the emperor, Invictus was to be granted his freedom. Mysteriously though, the emperor was killed and replaced by a crazy man named Arruntius. Arruntius, so full of himself, has decided to destroy Rome and replace it with a city named Arruntium. As the game begins, an epic event is staged with Invictus as the gladiator. Invictus fights bravely, but he is killed by an unknown and possibly un-human creature. In the afterlife, Invictus meets the sons of Jupiter. They inform him of how Arruntius' power came from help of the gods of terror. They charge him with the task of eliminating Arruntius and restoring Rome to glory.Gladiator is essentially an 3d action/combat game which features hand to hand combat with weapons, combos and magic. The action also includes maneuvering around, from gliding down ropes to jumping traps. Challenges are scattered around the game world, which when defeated, unlock magical powers granted by the gods, such as Pluto's power, which raises spirits from the dead to help you in battle. A unique feature of the game is the execution maneuver. Upon the near death of certain enemies, you can execute this maneuver which will result in a cinematic random brutal execution by Thrax.The game's graphics try to recreate the atmosphere of gladiator films such as Spartacus. A wide range of characters are featured from opposing gladiators to mythical enemies like cyclopes, demons. and skeleton warriors. Audio features include a blend of soft and hectic tunes, and voice over acting.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-11-05</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Electronic Arts Redwood Shores Studio</td><td>Action</td><td>Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Hack and slash, RPG elements</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King video game again puts the fate of middle-earth in the hands of the gamer.

Players control Captain William Adama as he participates in 15 missions leading up to the end of the First Cylon War.Missions are tightly scripted. Players control three varieties of Viper fighters, as well as captured Cylon raiders, depending on the needs of the mission. Players also will man the stationary defense turrets on board the Galactica. Missions have clear goals, often with time limits, and are expressed and tracked through voiced radio chatter between wingmen and Galactica's war room.  Players are graded in a variety of areas after each level (including accuracy and keeping wingmen alive), and unlock upgrades and bonus material for high ratings.Players control their craft from either a first or third person view. Fighters have unlimited ammo, missiles, and auto-repair any damage taken, but only if enough recharging energy is available. Firing weapons and using afterburners drain energy, and the fighter only repairs itself when the energy level is full.  Players must be aware of their energy usage to keep from running out at critical moments.Missiles on every craft can also be configured on the fly through an option in the pause menu.  Pilots can program missiles to have increased power at the cost of speed, or increase maneuverability at the cost of blast radius.  This system allows players to adapt their missiles to the current needs of the mission, from swatting down formations of fighters to breaking through a capital ship's defenses.Though it acts as a prequel to the new series, art and design is pulled from the original 1978 Battlestar Galactica.  The intro from the original series is used. Cylons Raiders, Colonial Vipers, and the Galactica itself use the original designs, Cylons themselves look like the original chrome toasters, and the reptilian race that created them (in the original series, not the reboot) make appearances.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Outlaw Golf: 9 More Holes of X-Mas</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-11-15</td><td>Simon & Schuster Interactive</td><td>Hypnotix, Inc.</td><td>Action, Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">A Blockbuster Video Exclusive release.

Separated by sudden events, Raziel was forced to retreat into the spectral realm, leaving Kain to escape from the Serafan on his own. Both must escape the predicament they find themselves in and fight back against those who would seek to use them as manipulations in a grander plot. From both heroes cry out shouts of defiance, and a thirst to find the revelations that have been buried in the world of Nosgoth.Legacy of Kain: Defiance is a third-person action game with light puzzle-solving elements, combining concepts seen in both Blood Omen 2 and Soul Reaver 2. The story unfolds through chapters, focusing alternately on Kain and Raziel as they pursue their separate, though intertwined quests. Control of each character alternates between levels, however both are controlled from a behind-the-shoulder perspective. While both heroes are different, they are similar in movement, ability to attack, defend, jump and access special abilities. Kain and Raziel no longer pick up weapons, instead both using a form of the Soul Reaver weapon (Kain uses the physical sword form, Raziel uses an energy blade). Each Soul Reaver can now be "charged" to unleash a special ability, determined by the current alignment of Soul Reaver at the time. Both Kain and Raziel lose energy at a constant rate and must feed to replenish life energy (Kain feeds on the blood of living creatures,  Raziel feeds on the souls of living and non-living creatures). And both Kain and Raziel feature telekinetic abilities to manipulate objects at a distance. The two are, however, different characters that play differently, each requiring use of his talents, to bypass obstacles (sometimes the same obstacle). Kain focuses on strong combat and destructive abilities. He is able to power up the Soul Reaver weapon using properties of the Pillars of Nosgoth. Raziel is more subtle, able to use stealth and the phasing between material and spectral worlds in order to discover new paths. As in Soul Reaver, Raziel can phase into the spectral world at any time but must find a special location in order to phase back. Raziel powers up the Soul Reaver using elemental powers.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Magic: The Gathering - Battlegrounds</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-11-18</td><td>Atari, Inc.</td><td>Secret Level Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Fighting, Trading / collectible card</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td>Real-time</td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Magic: The Gathering - Battlegrounds is a real-time fighting/strategy game in which players use Magic: The Gathering cards to combat each other.

The game is very similar to its predecessor in gameplay concept and presentation, bringing back noir detective atmosphere, cinematic John Woo-style action, and cutscenes shaped like comic book panels.The game is built on the same engine as the predecessor, with several additional special effects and enhancements, such as dynamic shadows and lighting, cubic mapped reflections, and high resolution textures. The Havok engine with ragdoll physics is used to enhance the interactivity with the game world: objects can be moved and destroyed, physically responding to the actions of the player character and opponents.A new feature in the sequel is the possibility to use secondary weapons alongside regulars guns, namely melee strikes, grenades and Molotov cocktails.

The situation is gradually getting worse, as the rate of DomZ kidnapings increases.

In the midst of this situation, the secretive organization IRIS alleges that the Alpha Section is involved in a massive government conspiracy, and seeks to expose the truth through journalism.The player controls a young reporter and photographer named Jade with her companions Pey'j and Double H. After experiencing first-hand a DomZ attack, she is contacted by IRIS, who recruits her as an action reporter. Jade is now tasked with infiltrating the Alpha Section, exposing the government conspiracy, and ultimately finding the truth for herself.Beyond Good & Evil is an action game with diverse gameplay. Much of the game is based on stealth and puzzles, but there are sequences of racing, shooting, combat, and platform action. Jade fights with her staff and also uses various abilities to execute long-ranged attacks and solve puzzles. Many of the puzzles require switching between the characters and using their special abilities; often it is necessary to coordinate the actions of two characters to achieve precise co-operation that leads to a puzzle's solution. Besides hostile areas with puzzles and enemies, there is also a city and other friendly areas to explore, where various items and gadgets can (and sometimes must) be bought. There are several mini-games and even an online ranking system (used by entering codes online after they are assigned in-game when the game is saved). </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-12-02</td><td>Adventure Company, The</td><td>Revolution Software Ltd.</td><td>Adventure</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td>Detective / mystery</td><td>Graphic adventure, Puzzle elements, Quick Time Events (QTEs)</td><td>Africa, Europe, Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td>Cinematic camera</td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">No less than six years have gone by before the third installment in the Broken Sword series saw the light of day.

For the Windows version the game is no longer controlled through the mouse, but now through the keyboard, for the movement of the characters as well as all the actions.

The city of Chicago is destroyed in a devastating energy blast by unknown terrorists. Two trainees of the Tarsus Academy, Alex D and Billie Adams, are evacuated to another Tarsus-controlled facility in Seattle. Shortly thereafter the facility is attacked by members of a religious organization called the Order. Billie admits that she has been collaborating with them, implying that Tarsus may be involved in a conspiracy. It is now up to Alex to find his or her place in the new world, and ultimately shape its fate.Deus Ex: Invisible War is a first-person shooter that retains many gameplay elements of its predecessor, such as conversations with characters, inventory management, exploration, and mixing various gameplay styles during missions. As in the original game, the style of play helps shape the game as it progresses, from how characters interact with the protagonist to the types of situations encountered. Each potential conflict can be resolved in a number of ways, through peaceful means or through violence, using stealth or a show of force. Hacking computer terminals and unlocking doors with special tools are prominently featured.Weapons can be modified in a variety of ways, e.g. increasing their rate of fire, silencing the shots, allowing the weapon to shoot through glass, etc. Characters can once again outfit their bodies with an array of biotech parts, some of which include the ability to see through walls, disappear from radar, regenerate from critical hits, or jump forty feet in the air. Unlike the previous installment, there are no true role-playing elements in the game. The player must search for biotech canisters to install and upgrade biomods; however, no experience points are awarded for either completing missions or dealing with enemies. Inventory management has been simplified as well.The sequel places more emphasis on decisions and different approaches to missions. From the beginning of the game the player has the freedom of performing missions for organizations and people of his or her choice. Like in the first game, several endings can be reached depending on the player's decisions. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Escape 03</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-12-02</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td></td><td>Compilation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The Entertainment Software Charity (ESC) bundled together three games and sold the package for  £29.99.

Using specific attacks (e.g. unarmed) boosts the related skills, which can be leveled up.There are different flavours of weapons to be collected, from axes to  swords, spears and sabers, and even exotic variants such as falchion, firangi or gloive. New ones can be acquired during battle, but enemies can pick them up as well.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-12-09</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Warthog Games Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Two years after versions on other platforms, the then-current consoles got their own adaptation of the first Harry Potter book and film. Like in the computer and PlayStation versions, Harry Potter's first year at school of magic Hogwarts is presented as a 3D action-adventure title.After a tutorial at Ollivander's Wand Shop and an introductory first night at Hogwarts, the game is organized into distinct days and nights. Days mostly consist of lessons, where usually Harry will learn new spells. The more interesting stuff happens at night, of course, when Harry sneaks around the castle to do things like meeting Draco Malfoy for a duel, fighting a troll in the dungeons, and other important scenes from the film and book.Most tasks involve platform sections, where Harry has to jump over chasms and balance along edges. Often, creatures will be in the way that have to be fought using the correct spells, and magic must also be used to solve the occasional puzzle. At night, Harry must watch out for prefects patrolling the floors of the castle to avoid getting sent back to the common room. There's also broomstick flying in the game, including a Quidditch match against Slytherin.After classes, Hogwarts can be freely explored. At any time, it is possible to revisit school lessons to get better grades, often only possible after some more advanced spells have been learned. Also, lots of collectibles can be found both in the open and hidden areas: collecting 20 wizard cards increases Harry's health and Every Flavour Beans can be traded in Fred and George's shop for more cards and some other useful items.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">R:Racing Evolution</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-12-09</td><td>Namco Hometek Inc.</td><td>Namco Limited</td><td>Racing / Driving</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Europe, Oceania</td><td>Automobile, Track racing</td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">R:Racing Evolution is a racing game featuring several modes of gameplay:Racing Life: This is a single player story mode.

However, after one night the sun of the world of Exosta never rose again, and the blistering cold   forced their inhabitants into the dwarf mines. There, a new city was built, and humans, trolls, goblins, dwarves, and other races lived along peacefully, until the scarce resources proved to be too few for everyone. The animosity started to build up, and conflict between races ensued. The protagonist starts the game dazed out, being dragged into a cell by a goblin. Where is he? Why did he end up there? Who is he? With only that in mind, the adventure starts...Inspired by the Ultima Underworld series, Arx Fatalis is a first-person role-playing game taking place in a vast underground world. All the locations and interconnected by passages, tunnels, and stairs, with eight levels altogether. Despite their dungeon-like appearance, locations also include populated settlements such as the city of Arx, where the player character can buy and store supplies, as well as other non-hostile areas. The player, however, is free to attack and possibly kill any non-player character encountered. While several main quests must be completed in a specific order to unlock a new area, the player can access and explore certain locations freely at some points in the game. There are no dialogue options, but some missions can be completed in different ways, and there are also a few side quests.The player generates and builds up the main character by customizing his main attributes (strength, intelligence, dexterity, and constitution) as well as various skills, which include close or ranged combat proficiencies, technical skill for lockpicking and disarming traps, and others. Vanquishing enemies and completing quests yields experience points, which are converted to attribute and skill points when the protagonists levels up and can be allocated manually. Much of the combat in the game can be avoided, and the player may opt to develop a stealthy character, a spellcaster, a ranged attacker, as well as the traditional physical type. Combat in the game is action-based. The player can press down the attack key to build up force in order to strike more efficiently. It is also possible to execute several types of melee attacks by combining them with directional arrows. One of the unique aspects of the game is the spell-casting system, where the player uses the mouse (or the directional pad in the Xbox version) to draw the runes constituting a particular spell. The most complex spells can be performed by combining runes. Spells can also be readied and cast simply by pressing a corresponding key. Casting spells depletes the protagonist's magic points. As some places lack light sources, players can take advantage of the darkness to stealthily move in the shadows, or use torches to lighten up a room to search for some object or find their way in a path. The game's world offers interactivity by allowing the player to pick up, drag, and place most objects. Food must be collected and eaten periodically to prevent the protagonist from dying of hunger. The player can combine various items to create new ones, as well as modify their properties. For example, it is possible to cook food, bake bread, use tools such as pickaxes and shovels, and brew potions.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">IHRA Drag Racing 2004</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2003-12-25</td><td>Bethesda Softworks LLC</td><td>Super Happy Fun Fun, Inc.</td><td>Racing / Driving</td><td>1st-person, 3rd-person (Other), Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Managerial / business simulation</td><td></td><td>Automobile, Track racing, Vehicle simulator</td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">An upgrade of Bethesda's earlier IHRA Drag Racing titles.

On the rough frontier, it falls to the Terran Colonial Authority to maintain peace and order among the outlying colonies and outposts. TCA Marshal John Dalton and the crew of his ship, the Atlantis, patrol this dangerous sector of space when several distress calls lead to the discovery of alien artifacts with unique properties. Soon, the hunt for these artifacts is on between several alien factions as well as human corporations and their mercenary forces, with the TCA and their allies caught in the middle.The first-person shooter Unreal II, while a sequel to Unreal, has no direct connection to the first game except being set in the same universe (with the Skaarj from Unreal and the Liandri Corporation from Unreal Tournament being major enemy factions). The player controls John Dalton through a dozen missions, taking place in such locations as the dense jungle of a tropical planet, a research facility on a frozen moon, the insides of a planet-sized living organism, the home world of an insectoid machine civilization, as well as a huge starship.The weapon arsenal consists of more than a dozen guns. Standard types include pistols, an assault rifle, shotgun, and sniper rifle. Some heavier ones are a flame thrower, as well as rocket and grenade launchers, with the grenade launcher being able to use six different ammunition types, including fragmentation, EMP and smoke grenades. Available in later missions are weapons adapted from alien technologies. These include various energy guns, a biological weapon that creates living spiders that attack enemies, and an autonomous floating orb that either seeks out and attacks enemies or circles around the player in point defense. As in other Unreal titles, each weapon has two different firing modes.Missions are usually of the run-and-gun type, but there are exceptions. Several levels include defense assignments where either a position must be held for a certain time or a character be kept alive. These levels usually include additional tools such as energy barriers and automated turrets that can be placed by the player in any location. Sometimes, AI-controlled characters will be there to help out the player as well. In that case they can be given orders on which sector to defend or patrol, for example.The story of the game is told through a variety of means: besides in-engine cutscenes, there is a lot of radio chatter during a mission; in fact, it's not unusual for mission objectives to completely change due to story developments. Between missions, Dalton can wander freely about the Atlantis and chat with his crew, going into their personal backstories as well as more details about the main plot.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Wrath Unleashed</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-02-10</td><td>LucasArts</td><td>Collective, Inc., The</td><td>Action, Strategy</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Fighting</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td>Real-time, Turn-based</td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Wrath Unleashed is a strategy game with both turn-based and real-time components, as well as action-oriented battles, similar in concept to Archon: The Light and the Dark. The gods of the four Elements (Water, Fire, Earth, and Wind) inhabit an asteroid belt, the only remnant of their former world, which has been shattered to pieces. The gods are waging war on each other, each trying to reclaim the coveted throne of Gaia. Each of the gods represents an alignment: Light Order, Light Chaos, Dark Order, or Dark Chaos, ranging from the most benevolent to the most evil. Their armies consist of supernatural creatures. The player can choose to command any of the armies, taking it to victory through four campaign missions each.In the game's campaign mode, the units are navigated in turn-based fashion over a board of hexagonal spaces, each representing a type of terrain. The main objectives of this strategic part of the game usually involve occupying the opposing army's temples or defeating specific enemies. When two opposing units meet on the same hexagonal space, a battle ensues. The battles take place on large arenas, and are a combination of real-time strategy and pure action. The player can take control of individual fighters and engage in direct arcade-like combat against the opponents.Versus and team fighter modes are available, both removing all the strategic elements, retaining only the action battles. Also included is an editor that allows players to create and customize their own soldiers and units.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">007: Everything or Nothing</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-02-17</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Electronic Arts Redwood Shores Studio</td><td>Action</td><td>Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td>Spy / espionage</td><td>Shooter</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">A nanobot has been stolen from the work of a world-renowned scientist, Dr. Katya Nadanova, of the Oxford Department of Microtechnology by a man known only as "the General", who has kidnapped Dr Nadanova as well.

These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.When an opponent sends Nuisance Puyos to your screen you can try to "offset" by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to your opponent.

Two men jump into his cab, telling him to drive as fast as he can. Bullets begin to hit the cab, and a car with armed pursuers gets closer. Barely escaping a violent death, Tommy obeys the instructions of the two men and delivers them to a bar of their choice. Impressed with his driving skills, the men pay him and offer him a job in the mafia. The next day, while Tommy is taking a coffee break, his cab is smashed by two rival gangsters. After this, he recalls the proposition from yesterday, and, without much hesitation, joins the Salieri family, making his first steps on the path of organized crime. While performing missions for Salieri, Tommy gradually begins to regret his choice. However, it turns out that joining the mafia was much easier than leaving it.Mafia is an action and driving game set in the 1930s in Lost Heaven, a fictional city in the USA modeled after New York and Chicago of the Prohibition Era.  Similar to GTA games, it consists of free-roaming (driving or on foot) in a large city, completing missions to advance the narrative. The missions often include driving to various locations, car chases, and one race; however, most of them are structured like fairly large and long third-person shooter levels.The player will have the chance to drive over sixty vehicles that are reminiscent of the 1930's period. Each car handles it differently, with various degrees of damage. It is possible to smash windows, destroy bumpers, lights, and mirrors, dent the car, shoot out the tires, or shoot the tires so much that they fall off. To add to the realism, if the car's gas tank gets punctured, gas will slowly leak out until the car totally empties. There are gas stations scattered throughout the city, allowing the player to refuel. With these vehicles, the player is able to explore twelve square miles of the city, visiting areas such as Central Island, Chinatown, and the Downtown district.Complementing the vehicles is an array of weapons, such as pistols, tommy guns, shotguns, explosives, baseball bats, and crowbars. While driving a car, Tommy can perform a drive-by, sticking his hand out the window and firing. Trying to impede him is the police force; they will act on anything suspicious.  If they see Tommy carrying a weapon, they will attempt to arrest him. Going over the speed limit, running red lights, crashing into buildings, cars, or objects will result in fines.Tommy is often given new cars to use during the missions, usually provided by Ralph, the mechanic of the Salieri family. The player can also save hijacked cars in the backyard of the bar belonging to Salieri. Weapons can be acquired at the beginning of a mission by Vincenzo, the local arms dealer.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">MVP Baseball 2004</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-03-09</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Electronic Arts Canada</td><td>Sports</td><td>Behind view, Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Step up to the plate for the second iteration of EA Sports' MVP Baseball.

As Derrick Cole awakens in a recovery facility near Site Zero, he fails to remember anything from his past. Apparently, he was injected T'langen, a fluid that was taken from the T'lan, which has unexpected effects on human organism. As the war between the humans and the T'lan begins, Derrick must first of all find a way to escape, with both sides being hostile to him, unaware of the role he will play in the future of both races.Breakdown is a first-person action game. Though Derrick can use firearms, it is not entirely a FPS; much of the game's combat relies on melee moves and combos that Derrick learns, turning the game into a "first-person fighter". An unusual feature of the game is the completely physical interaction with the environment, which strives to be realistic. In order to force Derrick to pick up ammo, operate an object, eat food to restore health, etc., the player has to physically move the controller, imitating corresponding real-life movements.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Ford Racing 3</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-03-22</td><td>Empire Interactive Europe Ltd.</td><td>Razorworks</td><td>Racing / Driving</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Automobile, Off-roading, Track racing, Vehicle simulator</td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Ford Racing 3 is the sequel to Ford Racing 2.Now there are 55 Ford models available (Ford GTs, Thunderbirds, concepts, SVT vehicles, Mustangs and Trucks) and you unlock them as you win the races.Twenty six tracks are available, including road, off-road and oval ones, in different environments (snow, mud, water, mountain trails, beach, race tracks and more).It has 2 play modes: Ford Competition and Ford Challenge.

Meanwhile, Garrett learns that the coming of a Dark Age had been prophesied long ago. Gaining access to the Keeper Prophecies, Garrett learns that an ancient book known as the Compendium of Reproach contains more information about the prophecy. As Garrett is trying to solve the mystery, it becomes more and more clear to him that there is a traitor in the order of the Keepers.Thief: Deadly Shadows is the third installment in the Thief series. The game follows the same design philosophy and gameplay structure that distinguished its predecessors. As before, stealth is the key to successful completion of missions. Avoiding confrontation with the guards, Garrett has to make his way through the levels towards the objective. Shadows and sounds play a large role, as guards will react to suspicious noises, and studying their patrolling routines is essential.A few gameplay elements have been slightly altered. Garrett can no longer swim, but is able to use climbing gloves that attach him to the walls. He can also flatten himself against walls while standing; if in shadow, he remains completely unnoticeable that way. The player can see Garrett's limbs even if he is viewed from first-person perspective, allowing more precise movements. Switching to third-person view is also possible.The most significant gameplay change is the non-linear exploration of the City, which has been added to the largely linear missions. In order to access the next mission, Garrett has to explore the City. On his way, he can overhear conversations, steal valuables, avoid or knock out the guards, and even accept secondary missions, which will influence his reputation with some of its factions.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Aoi Namida (Shokaiban)</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-05-27</td><td>Panther Software Inc.</td><td>Artlim Media</td><td>Adventure</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td>Visual novel</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Setting</td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Aoi Namida is romance adventure game presented as a visual novel.

You can tell your two squads to do numerous things, such as hide behind a wall, take cover behind a car, lob a grenade, fire off a rocket, or attack a target. You will need to utilize both squads to be successful.

You will have to make your way through parks, an airport, city streets, and even some buildings. Throughout the country are many terrorists, all of whom are trying to kill you.

On 13 tracks (which must be played free in single-player first) you need all your driving skills to survive and make it to the finish as the 1st with one of the four different cars available (from slow ones to really fast ones).The heart of the single-player mode (besides the quick battle against the AI) are the bronze, silver and gold challenges for every track you need to complete to play free the next track. Each challenge is one of the seven (eight in multiplayer) game modes available in Mashed. From normal race-events (just be the 1st) over battles where you need to kill all your enemies before they do to the ultimate survival mode where everyone doesn't really like you.To make things much easier there are nine different power-ups and weapons scattered on the tracks which you can pick up. From simple oil slicks over mines to deadly mortars there's everything you need to kick the enemy drivers out of the race. Of course they can also choose from the equipment. As you can only survive a few hits you need to make sure they can't use them on you. And to make it even worse there are many small passages (or the track is just one small passage...) with nothing on one or both sides of the track in which you or your enemy can fall very deep.But the real heart of Mashed is the split-screen multiplayer mode which you can play with up to four players on one PC. If you don't find four friends you can fill in the missing spots with bots or just leave them open. The additional eighth, multiplayer exclusive game mode is like CTF with cars. The goal is to hold the flag and drive as far away from the enemies as possible to get a point. To keep the race interesting for the players that are already out of it, they can use a helicopter which flies over the track to launch missile attacks on the cars still racing. So you can take your revenge before the race is even over and the racers have one more thing to worry about. But this feature can be deactivated when you setup the race.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Driv3r</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-06-21</td><td>Atari, Inc.</td><td>Reflections Interactive Limited</td><td>Action, Racing / Driving</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td></td><td>Detective / mystery, Spy / espionage</td><td>Sandbox / open world, Shooter</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Continuing from the storyline of the previous Driver games, players reprise their role as the undercover cop Tanner, this time infiltrating a worldwide high-performance car theft ring.Nothing is too dangerous or too risky for Tanner, as he'll hop into any car, truck, or motorcycle, and cruise the streets of three re-created cities (Miami, Nice and Istanbul) with over 156 miles of roads, in more than 25 storyline missions featuring some characters from the previous installments.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">IndyCar Series 2005</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-06-22</td><td>Codemasters Software Company Limited, The</td><td>Codemasters Software Company Limited, The</td><td>Racing / Driving, Simulation</td><td>1st-person, 3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Automobile, Track racing, Vehicle simulator</td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Following in the footsteps of the previous game, IndyCar Series 2005 once again puts players inside the world of high-speed racing.Choose Quick Race to get straight onto the speedway, IndyCar Series to race the entire Indy circuit, or Indy 500 to experience the thrills of the Indianapolis 500 from qualifying to race day.The game includes 4 skill levels (Easy, Normal, Pro and Custom), 15 race tracks, a long list of famous professional drivers to choose from, garage tweaking and tuning, driver profile customization, and the "Masterclass Course" tutorial.

Altogether, there are fifteen characters, ten of whom need to be unlocked.Basically, gameplay is almost identical to that of Dynasty Warriors.

In Samurai Warriors, there are soldiers, archers, musketeers, and many different types of ninjas.  In terms of story, there are basically only five levels, but depending on your actions in a certain level specific to each character, the story will branch of into two different stories, leading to a good ending or a not as good ending.

Chris Berman, who did voiceover for the half-time show in 2K4, returns for this season.  Instead of just voice, there is a virtual Chris Berman, who does an introduction to each game, a half-time report, and a post-game show.  To illiustrate certain points, he uses replays from each game.  Every move you pull off of every quarter of every game is saved and used in these replays (Xbox only).  Suzy Kobler gives reports from the sideline.One new feature is the V.I.P. system, which keeps track of how you play the game.  If you pass 80% of the time, and run 20% of the time, your V.I.P. profile will reflect this.  At a later time, you can play against your V.I.P., and the AI will play as if it were you.ESPN celebrates it's 25th anniversary this year, and as such, a special 25th Anniversary Mode has been added.  This mode allows you to play moments from classic football games, including The Heidi Bowl and The Immaculate Reception.The Crib has an overhaul this year.  Instead of earning specific items by completing tasks, you earn points, which you can use to buy items of your choice.  New to the Crib is a dart board, as well as a phone, which you will use to answer calls from celebrities.  You may get a call from Steve-O, Carmen Electra, Jamie Kennedy, David Arquette or Funkmaster Flex, challenging you to a game.Franchise mode also gets an overhaul.  New to 2005 is the ability to schedule weekly preps for your team.  You can choose to have players work out, play practice games, watch tapes, all in an effort to gear your team up for the next game.ESPN NFL 2K5 can be played over Xbox Live, with future support for leagues.  The game is also "always connected", as long as you have an internet connection.  This allows it to keep buddy lists up to date, see friends, receive requests, all the time, whether you're actually playing an online game or not.  Roster updates will be available in the future.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Sudeki</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-07-20</td><td>Microsoft Game Studios</td><td>Climax Solent</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td>Action RPG</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Set in a world where realms of dark and light co-exist on top of each other, Queen Luscia of Haskillia is troubled by invasions of the Aklorians.

Rhama and Areliano are betrayed, and soon the Captain finds himself on the run; but that doesn't mean that he abandons the quest. Aided by Faith, Areliano's lovely daughter, and other friends he meets on his journey, Rhama is determined to bring the betrayer to justice and deliver the ship's legacy to the right hands.Galleon is a 3D action game with platforming elements, created by the designers of the original Tomb Raider. Like in most other games of this kind, most of the gameplay is dedicated to jumping and climbing, with some combat thrown in. However, Galleon includes many less typical elements. Rhama possesses extraordinary acrobatic skills and can run on walls and perform very long jumps. The game has an unusual control scheme, which makes Rhama respond to the amount of pressure the player applies to the analog stick, allowing various and precise combinations of running and jumping, including the possibility to influence character movement during free fall. Further stand-out features include cooperation between characters (similarly to  ICO, though Rhama has two female companions), treasure hunt system (Rhama can use his pirate senses to discover hidden treasures), and boss battles that require climbing on the enemies to destroy them,  Shadow of the Colossus-style.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Army Men: Sarge's War</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-08-02</td><td>Global Star Software Inc.</td><td>3DO Company, The</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The story: in a new, grittier direction for the Army Men series, Sargeant Hawk takes on his most insidious enemy yet: Lord Malice.

There are also expansions to the franchise mode and to online modes along various other additions and changes.Major changes to defensive play include the introduction of the Hit Stick: it allows precise and context-sensitive tackling through the use of the second analog stick.

The offense was also expanded and now allows for formation shifts on the line.The franchise mode now features the Storyline Central option, which features an "EA Sports Radio" show hosted by Tony Bruno, featuring news and reports around games and the league, interviews with players and call-ins from fans. There are also newspaper articles (featuring real licensed papers from around the US), emails from players and coaches and more. All of this is accessed through a redesigned interface resembling a PDA.

In this strategy game, you become the scourge of humanity by managing haunting teams consisting of various ghosts. The levels, usually inspired by famous scenes from horror movies, require you to scare mortals and complete additional objectives such as freeing trapped ghosts. Deployed ghosts need to be bound to certain objects, called fetters, that match their type.By scaring humans, you collect plasm, the main resource in the game. Plasm can be used to recruit new ghosts, or expand their abilities. Rather than deploying a massive amount of creatures, the game rewards creative use of limited resources to haunt mortals in original ways. Each human has a believe meter. An important aspect is figuring out each human's weakness. As you exploit this, they become more susceptible to various phenomena and provide more plasm. Along the way, you will meet fierce resistance as ghostbreakers, priests and witches can detect and ban your ghosts.The game is not a direct port. Instead, Spiral House was contracted to modify the original codebase by Sick Puppies to make it more user-friendly for the consoles. This includes a complete overhaul of the interface to make commands easier to access, the introduction of battle elements - next to the regular missions - to speed up the game's pace, a more linear game structure, and a redesign of the control over ghosts. They now have less AI and there is more variety in the types, requiring you to tap wisely into the plasm pool to deploy the most adequate ghost for each situation.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Rapala Pro Fishing</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-08-27</td><td>Activision Value Publishing, Inc.</td><td>FUN Labs Romania S.R.L.</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Rapala Pro Fishing takes you through 12 locations such as Mille Lacs Minnesota, Sam Rayburn Texas, Lake Okeechobee, and the Amazon.You'll fish for 13 game fish species such as largemouth and smallmouth bass, catfish, muskie, walleye and king salmon.

On one strange night, Henry has a terrible nightmare, with recurring events: his phone is dead, his windows are sealed, and his neighbors can't hear him.  He looks at his door, only to see it is blocked by several thick metal chains. A note is pinned to the door: "Don't go out!"  It is signed only by a man named Walter.  Henry explores his apartment, trying to figure out what is happening, when he spots a giant hole in the wall of his bathroom.  Henry goes through the hole, only to find a portal which leads him to alternate dimensions.  Hopefully, Henry will find out the truth about his apartment, Room 302, and live.Silent Hill 4: The Room is similar to past games in terms of atmosphere.  The game is dark and foreboding, never letting the player know what's behind the next corner or down the street. This installment of the series includes multiple new features. Henry never actually leaves his apartment: he utilizes a strange portal to travel to alternate dimensions, including a hospital, a cult command center deep in the forest, and a prison. Aside from the traditional third-person-view, there is now a first-person mode, which is used to control Henry when he is in his apartment.  Objects that can be interacted with are highlighted by eyeball icons.The previous games in the series have mostly been about exploring the town and solving puzzles; this installment has much more combat involved.  There are more enemies in a given area, and more narrow areas and cramped spaces. Henry mostly uses a standard Silent Hill arsenal of weapons, such as the steel pipe, pistol, and (new to this game) a golf club.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Burnout 3: Takedown</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-09-08</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Criterion Software Ltd.</td><td>Action, Racing / Driving</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Automobile, Street racing</td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Burnout 3: Takedown is a racing game which encourages aggressive driving and lets you use your vehicle to smash your way to the finish line by taking out your rivals and causing massive multi-car pileups.

When the deed is done, destiny unravels: the once peaceful town is suddenly under attack by bandit raids. The frightened child soon discovers his world crumbling in a matter of moments. Lying beside the body of his dead father, the boy is attacked by the gang, but is fortunately saved by a hero called Maze. He is then taken to the Heroes Guild where he is raised. Time has passed and the child has grown, and is ready to take up his own quest to rid the land of monsters and discover who was responsible for the deaths of his family.Fable is a third-person action role-playing game that casts the player as "the child" or "the hero" who must perform various deeds to graduate from the Heroes Guild and define himself. The story progresses when the hero chooses "main quest items" from the Guild. Alternatively, there are also other quests that the player may complete in order to obtain gold and fame. Some quests allow the hero to "boast" in front of his fans. Boasting before a quests adds added difficulty, such as "completing the quest naked," however will allow additional gold and fame to be obtained.The game introduces a "good and evil" morality system, similar to that of Knights of the Old Republic. Various situations - for example coming across a child being bullied - will force the player to make decisions which ultimately shape the main character. Making decisions deemed "good" earns the player good points, while being selfish and "bad" earns evil points instead. These decisions not only alter character stats, but also the hero's appearance and even the environment around them. "Evil" characters tend to look the part; growing horns, receiving scars and having a swarm of flies buzzing around him. A "good" character, on the other hand, might receive a halo and have butterflies swarming. However, other actions such as receiving wounds in combat or casting large amounts of magic also affect the player's appearance.Actions also end up impacting the player's reputation, including actions that might be relatively unimportant in other games.  For instance, if a player kicks a lot of chickens, various people might start referring to them by the title of "Chicken Chaser"; using "good" alignment magic might cause people to start calling the hero "Runemaster" instead.There are three main modes of combat in Fable: melee, ranged and magic. The hero can equip any number of weapons, from swords to axes, and a variety of spells to either harm or help. What the hero wears also determines how people interact with them. Bright, saintly armor tends to make townspeople more willing to talk, while carrying a large axe and blood-red, darkened armor might cause them to be more apprehensive.An experience upgrade system allows the player to specialize in one area, or spread throughout, to give the hero a more all-around set of abilities. There are three areas in which experience is gained: Physical, Skill and Will. Physical experience is earned primarily by using melee weapons and can be used to upgrade the hero's strength or health. Skill experience is primarily gained through archery or trading and boosts archery prowess, speed or guile. Will experience is gained through magic usage and is spent on new spells or upgrading old ones.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Guilty Gear X2: The Midnight Carnival #Reload</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-09-14</td><td>Majesco Sales, Inc.</td><td>Arc System Works Co., Ltd., Sammy Corporation</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td>Fighting</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">#Reload is an update to Guilty Gear XX, which changes gameplay by balancing out a lot of the moves, also removing some of the moves which gave a character an unfair advantage over another.

You take on the role of a rookie soldier on his first tour of duty. Using a third-person perspective, you experience napalm bombardments of civilian villages, sneaky night missions along the river banks, claustrophobic tunnel systems and huge battles in temples and open fields. Most missions are played as a team, but your team members cannot die and do not influence the mission objectives. You will have to assassinate enemy generals, take out crucial boats and guide your team through unknown territory.The game does not have drivable vehicles, multiplayer options or extensive environmental interaction, but it features a particular system of dismantling the many bombs and traps: in a race against time, you have to perform a long key sequence in the correct order to clear the path. The atrocities on both sides are clearly shown in the cutscenes, filmed as through a shaky hand-camera. Either side is not afraid to abuse civilians for their cause and this sense of realism gives the game a rather raw edge. You can even purchase the services of hookers in the base camp.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Vietcong: Purple Haze</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-09-15</td><td>Gathering</td><td>Illusion Softworks, a.s., PTERODON, Ltd.</td><td>Action, Compilation</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td>War</td><td>Shooter</td><td>Asia, Cold War, Historical events</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Vietcong: Purple Haze is a compilation pack that bundles the original Vietcong game alongside its expansion pack Vietcong: Fist Alpha.

The vaccine was found, but at the time the world was engulfed into chaos. A new world order emerged, splitting the world into two distinct yet dependent worlds: Above and Below.The world Above reflects a chrome city, a high-rise, high-tech metropolis served by elevators and elevated freeways. A place for hardworkers and law-abiding people. On the contrary to Above, the world Below, which is the product of earthquake damages, is a subterranean network of labour colonies. Those who are not wanted Above for one reason or another are sent Below.One day, now veteran Headhunter, Jack Wade, took a call to investigate an intrusion to the upper levels. Facing the trespasser, Jack saw a potential in the girl and instead of turning her in, he gave her a second chance... to become his apprentice. Jack is back, but this time, he's not alone but accompanied by his sidekick Leeza X. Together, they will face whatever threat lurks from the world Below.The gameplay is set in 3rd-person view with ability to rotate camera or set it behind your back at the single click.

Also, IRIS will provide you with a full 3D map info even displaying the enemies so you can avoid them or use stealth if necessary. Enemies will hear you running and shooting, so if you decide to take an action, be aware that they will surround you and launch a team strike at you from all the sides. You only effective aid against them, beside your weapon, of course, is the ability to perform a roll or lean against the walls and fire from the corners, although aiming itself may not be easy as your hand will not be steady while on the move or panicking.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Second Sight</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-09-21</td><td>Codemasters Software Company Limited, The</td><td>Free Radical Design Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person, 3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td>Detective / mystery</td><td>Shooter, Stealth</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">After waking up in a high security medical facility with no recollection of how he got there, John Vattic's memory slowly returns through a series of playable flashbacks to his days as a civilian advisor to a military operation in Siberia.

You may perform tasks for people in between learning new techniques.  Konquest mode is a third-person game, which can almost be called a game by itself.  There are two new game modes, Chess Kombat and Puzzle Kombat.Chess Kombat is a standard game of chess, using fighters as pieces.

Tak and Jibolba, Tak's mentor, travel to visit Jibolba's brother, JB, who is an expert in dreams.Tak 2 is fairly different from Tak and the Power of Juju. While it is still a 3D platform game, it is more focused on puzzles and combat as opposed to collecting items.  In earlier stages, Tak must use animals to his advantage as he makes his way through levels - for example, a bear can be used as a trampoline, Tak can ride warthogs after being sprayed by skunks to mask his scent, and more.  Jibolba is along for the ride, but has transformed into a flea for easy transport.  As a result, you can throw him at enemies to bite them and make them sleepy.Later on, Tak gains the power to transform into various animals himself.  As a frog he can swim without being eaten by crocodiles, he can soar on air currents as a flying squirrel, and can break through barriers by charging through as a warthog.

It's also possible to create all kinds of competitions. 
The Career mode was also extended, allowing now up to 15 seasons, and giving the player the chance to turn the tide of a simulated match anytime. This mode is a "light" managerial mode, where the player not only plays, but also signs new players and increases the club's abilities in trainers, medical staff, and other club staff).
The main gameplay change was the addition of "First Touch" controls. By performing one of the "trick" moves before the player gets possession of the ball it's possible to do a number of moves, such as touching the ball forward to gain a few yards ahead of the defenders or touch the ball to one side, and roll to the other of a rushing defender, and then pick up up the ball a bit ahead leaving the opponent stranded, and the inclusion of a fake shot move, which allows forwards to sit a goalkeeper before scoring in style or make defenders jump from their positions, opening room for a through pass or a run into the goal. Other aspects of the game, such as the "Off The Ball" controls (allows the control of players that aren't in possession, moving them into an open position) remain unchanged.Another new feature is the FIFA Shop, where the player can trade points earned in many ways, from simple tasks like having a peek at the Jukebox to obtaining 10 victories in a row in Career mode, for several items, such as third jerseys, additional music, more balls and night stadiums.As it became the norm with the series, the game features 18 leagues and 38 national teams (some of these, due to licensing problems feature only generic kits and logos), summing up to around 11,000 real footballers. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Kingdom Under Fire: The Crusaders</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-10-12</td><td>Microsoft Game Studios</td><td>Phantagram Co., Ltd.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG), Strategy</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td>Real-time</td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This is a rare breed of console game: an RTS.

As many other recently released shoot'em'ups, it combines basic arcade shooter gameplay with modern 3D graphics to liven up the genre. The level backgrounds as well as all enemies are modeled in full 3D, with the action taking place in a vertically scrolling two-dimensional plane which moves through the level.As most of the other new-style SHMUPs, Psyvariar 2 has a gimmick: getting close to enemies or shots without actually being hit is called "buzzing" and yields massive extra score. In addition, the player ship's rate of fire is rather slow by default and can be raised by shaking the ship left and right a few times and then keeping moving horizontally - as soon as the horizontal movement stops, the fire rate drops down to normal again. As in most other of the new Japanese style of shoot'em'ups, there are usually an  extremely high number of enemy shots on the screen. All these factors combine to make learning precise control a central part of the game.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">The Bard's Tale</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-10-28</td><td>Vivendi Universal Games, Inc.</td><td>inXile Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Action RPG</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The Bard is a cynical, opportunistic musician who roams the country in search of carnal pleasures. However, this impatient and selfish fellow is compelled to accept the greatest quest of his life: save the princess Caleigh from a demonic cult that has kidnapped her. The unlikely hero must now explore the land in search of the princess, accompanied by the omnipresent Narrator who obviously can't stand the Bard and uses every opportunity to sarcastically comment on his actions. Furthermore, Fionnaoch, the mysterious abductor of the princess, does everything he can to stop the Bard, sending his minions after him.A self-proclaimed "quest for coin and cleavage", The Bard's Tale is an action RPG that is more of a whimsical take on role-playing games than a remake of the classic series.  As the Bard, players can fight off hordes of foes with blade and bow, and summon companions through magical Bard Songs. Leveling up allows the player to raise the character's main attributes and invest specialization points in the different types of weapons he can use. Magical companions must be sought out and then summoned during battles. After being summoned, they act pretty much like AI-controlled party members; some of them specialize in physical attacks and offensive spells, while others can heal the hero.During conversations the player can choose "nice" or "snarky" responses for the protagonist. While mostly used for humorous effect, some of these responses may affect subsequent events. The game uses the Dark Alliance engine and has a similar camera and control scheme.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Total Club Manager 2005</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-10-28</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Budcat Creations, LLC</td><td>Simulation, Sports, Strategy</td><td>Diagonal-down, Text-based / Spreadsheet</td><td></td><td></td><td>Managerial / business simulation</td><td></td><td></td><td>Menu structures</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Total Club Manager 2005 is EA's third game in the Total Club Manager series.

Godzilla's power is so feared that scientists have begun experimenting on it's DNA and creating artificial G-Cells of the monster's power. A group of aliens, named the Vortek decide to invade the Earth to take away G-Cells created using Godzilla's DNA. They do this by controlling various other gigantic monsters, who will battle amongst themselves. Only a monster with free-will would be able to destroy the Vortek's army and drive away the Vortek.Godzilla: Save the Earth is a 3-D Fighting game, somewhat of a sequel to Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee. Players choose from among 18 monsters, previously seen in Godzilla movies, with which to engage in battle and destruction.

For those who do not know the TV show, it works like this...Jesse and his team are to build a creation that will do a certain task within 7 days and by spending under $3000 and the vehicle must look stock when completed.So this game gives you the task of building a vehicle that does something such as drive through a swamp by floating on the water and using a large fan to make you move.In day one, you must design the vehicle.  In the early scenarios, you only have one pre-made design to choose from.  In later scenarios, you can choose from three pre-made designs.Days two through six are devoted to constructing the vehicle.  You can buy various parts for the vehicle, but most parts will need to be fabricated.  To do this, you will need to purchase raw materials such as sheets of metal or metal rods and assign the task of making something like a roll cage to one of the team members.  They will make the item within a certain period of time while you handle other things. Things you need to do include removing parts from the vehicle or attaching parts to the vehicle as needed, and welding items to the vehicle or cutting items off the vehicle.  Every weld and cut is already set up for you and you just follow the line indicated.  Bolts are unscrewed or screwed on as needed.By day seven, your vehicle will have to have been completed, or you will need to try again.  Day seven is used only to update the look of your vehicle.  This includes adding certain custom parts such as gold plated rims, painting the vehicle, and applying decals.Once you are ready, you will take your vehicle to test it out and see if it works.  If you made it to day seven without being required to start over, your vehicle will work.  This is really just a test where you must complete a track in a certain amount of time.  For example, in one mission, you will have to make it around a snow-covered track in your upgraded car that has snowmobile tracks added to help with tracking within a certain amount of time.  You get as many tries as you need to complete this.  Once done, you can move on to the next mission.The challenges of this game are to stay under the $3000 when buying/selling parts and to complete the track at the end.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Sonic Mega Collection Plus</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-11-02</td><td>SEGA of America, Inc.</td><td>Sonic Team</td><td>Action, Compilation</td><td>Side view, Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td></td><td></td><td>Takashi Ishihara</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">A special extended version of the popular GameCube compilation ported for the PS2 and Xbox, Sonic Mega Collection Plus contains 20 of the most popular Sonic the Hedgehog and SEGA Genesis titles in one convenient set.

Battles are turn-based, and let the gamer make different decisions on what they want to do to change the outcome of the battle.

Twenty years later, Bradley has reached a new high point in his career: he succeeded in digitizing a human being into the computer and stored the secret of this technique in the Ma3a program. However, the powerful Future Control Industries (fCon) has gained access to this groundbreaking invention, and digitized hackers with the intention of dominating the computer network from within. Alan Bradley is kidnapped, and his son Jet, a computer game programmer, enters the world inside the computer, searching for answers.TRON 2.0 is based on the events of the CG rendered 1982 film TRON, and has been conceived as a sequel to it. The game is a first-person shooter with light role-playing elements. As Jet Bradley, the player must battle digital opponents using guns, rods, grenades, missiles, and the iconic TRON disc. The named of locations and opponents resemble those of programs and other computer-related terms, sometimes with a humorous intention. Using most weapons, as well as acquiring ("downloading") various kinds of items depletes the player character's energy bar. Energy and health can be replenished at special terminals or gained in small amounts by defeating enemies. The RPG elements appear in form of special items that can be collected and leveling up the player character, allowing the player to upgrade his parameters. The protagonist's level ("version") increases when a sufficient amount of so-called "build notes" has been collected. The player is free to increase any of the protagonist's five main attributes when leveling up. In addition, various "sub-routines" belonging to three classes - combat, defense, and utility - can be found and equipped. These may grant the main character special abilities, new weapons, or combat modifications. Each sub-routine can also be upgraded.Players can race against each other in multiplayer light cycle races, designed by Syd Mead, the film’s concept and original light cycle designer. The game has unusual visuals, representing the inside of a computer program (stylized after the movie). It includes the voice acting of many actors and actresses who were part of the original movie cast.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Bejeweled: Deluxe</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-11-04</td><td>Oberon Media, Inc.</td><td>PopCap Games, Inc.</td><td>Puzzle</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Falling block puzzle, Tile matching puzzle</td><td></td><td></td><td>Point and select</td><td>Turn-based</td><td></td><td>Fixed / flip-screen</td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">GoalThe object of the game is to score as many points as possible by swapping adjacent gems to create sets, either horizontal or vertical, of 3 or more identical gems.ControlsSwap any two adjacent gems by clicking on one, then the one you want to swap it with.

One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze.

Once all are removed, you proceed to the next level.Unique (at least I didn't saw it elsewhere) about the bricks is, that there are not only fixed and straight moving bricks, but there is also "vibration" in some levels. In example in the Underwater World, bricks will swing in complex patterns, both up/down or left/right, some of them even "fly" more chaotic.The game offers 4 different main worlds (like Underwater, Volcano, or an Alien world) with 4 sub-worlds each. Each of the sub-worlds have 10 levels, so you can play 160 different levels. There are 4 different difficulty settings available.On your journey through the game, you encounter lots of usual Power-Ups, like Small/Big Ball, Slow/Fast Ball, Catcher (to prevent loosing the ball), Multiball, 8-Ball, Laser equipped paddle, the all destroying ball (here it's the corrosive ball). But there also Power-Ups to create new balls (not through multiplying), Power-Ups that change the type of other bricks. Or how about a laser firing ball? But there are much more things in the game.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Super Collapse!

Once that happens, all blocks above the ones, which have vanished, will fall down and close the gap.Beneath the lowest row, there you see the new row building up. Once all blocks are present, this row will be now the lowest row, while all others are moving up. Once one block reaches the top of the playfield, you loose.Each individual level has a preset value of rows, which will build up. To win a level, all you have to do, is to prevent that a full vertical row (from bottom to top) gets stacked up.The game offers 4 game modes: Traditional, Puzzle, Relapse, and Strategy. Two of them need a brain, while the other two just need a fast hand.Traditional works like explained above. New rows show automatically, with increasing speed not only from level to level, but also in a level. Means: the level starts slow, but in the end, new rows will complete every second. Power-Ups are available in this game mode.Relapse works exactly like Traditional, but with one major difference. The action isn't just limited to the bottom of the playfield, in fact, both bottom and top now filling with blocks. Power-Ups used on one side affecting both. How to win is the same, but you loose, when blocks from one side touching the other.Strategy is one of the two game modes where you must think. Clicking fast will only help to see the Game Over screen. New rows won't appear automatically, instead for each cluster you remove, a full new line will appear. So you have to plan carefully before neutralizing a cluster.Puzzle is the game mode, where no new lines appear. Also there are no Power-Ups here. But this is the most complex game mode. Your task is to completely remove all blocks, if at least one block is still available, you loose. There is also no time limit, so you can think as long as you want.The first three game modes offering bonus levels, which works like the Puzzle mode. So, if one block remains, you only scoring the normal points for removed clusters. Only when all blocks are removed, you score the bonus points. There are only two differences: it isn't so complex, and you only have 15 seconds time.There are 5 different Power-Ups in the game (2 good, 2 bad, 1 depending of the situation): Platform Block (won't move, just blocking the vertical row where it is), Indestructible Block (does move like a regular block, but can't removed with normal actions), Color Bomb (one of each of the 5 colors, will detonate all same colored blocks in it's big radius), Super Bomb (shorter range than the Color Bomb, but blow up all blocks, regardless the color; only way to remove Platform/Indestructible Blocks), and finally, the Gravity Block (only available in Relapse Mode, will shift all blocks from the side where it was activated to the other side).</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Ultra Bust-a-Move</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-11-04</td><td>Majesco Sales, Inc.</td><td>Taito Corporation</td><td>Puzzle</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Tile matching puzzle</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Real-time</td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Back of Case - XBox (US) (from Ad Blurbs)The famous, bubble-bursting franchise is back as Ultra Bust-A-Move makes its Xbox Live debut!

For some reason, however, their fleet is much smaller than expected. To solve this mystery, the Chief must return to the stars, learning more about the mysterious Halo rings and their constructors.Meanwhile, the Covenant Elite who commanded the fleet at the Halo construct is blamed for the destruction of the ring and branded a heretic. The High Prophets grant him another chance, however: he is made the Arbiter, a special operative for the Prophets, ordered to carry out impossible missions. He will be dealing with dissent and rebellion among the Covenant - a conflict where he might find himself to be on the wrong side.The player controls both the Chief and the Arbiter in Halo 2, a first-person shooter in the same style as the first game. Its main gameplay characteristics are the same: only two weapons can be carried at a time (leading to a tactical choice as to which are to be taken), instead of a standard health points system there is the recharging energy shield (leading to an emphasis on finding cover during firefights), AI-controlled teammates will fight along with the protagonist, and there are lots of sections involving vehicles.New features include the ability to double-wield certain weapons, doubling the firing rate at the expense of accuracy, and the ability to execute melee attacks or throw grenades. Part of the weapon arsenal is unchanged from the first game, but there are also some additions. The human projectile weapons are mostly new and include a pistol, shotgun, SMG, and battle rifle. Returning are the sniper rifle and the rocket launcher. The Covenant energy-based weapons (still prone to overheating) from Halo all return, and new additions include several heavy hitters like the Brute Shot and Fuel Rod Gun along with the projectile-based Carbine and the Beam Rifle, both useful for sniping. The Energy Sword is a powerful melee weapon, able to kill most enemies with a single strike.All vehicles from the original game also return: Warthog jeeps and Scorpion tanks for the Humans, Banshee fliers, Ghost gliders, and Wraith tanks for the Covenant. A new addition is the Covenant Spectre, which with its rear-mounted cannon wielded by a dedicated gunner is comparable to the Warthog. A new player ability concerning vehicles is to board them while in use and either kick off the driver and take over or in the case of heavy tanks, throw in a grenade.The multiplayer component of the game has been greatly expanded. On the Xbox, Xbox Live is now supported in addition to split-screen and system link. The campaign can be played by two players on split-screen. Competitive game types include Slayer and Team Slayer (standard free-for-all deathmatch), Capture the Flag, Assault (planting a bomb in the enemy base), Territories (controlling sections of a map for a certain amount of time), Oddball (finding a skull on the map and then holding on to it as long as possible) and more. All types have several built-in variants and can also be customized further. Players can choose from Spartan and Covenant Elite skins. The PC version comes with a map editor.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Halo 2 (Limited Collector's Edition)</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-11-09</td><td>Microsoft Corporation</td><td></td><td>Special edition</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This is the regular release of Halo 2 but with exclusive content.

It's similar to Dance Dance Revolution, but with singing instead of dancing.  Players sing using the Logitech PS2 Headset (or other approved PlayStation 2 USB microphone devices).  The game rates the player's performance based on their vocal pitch and timing.  A visual indicator shows the player's current pitch in real time and also the pitch of vocals of the original song.  If the original notes of the song are too high for the player's vocal range, the game allows the player to sing at higher or lower octaves to hit the correct notes.  If the player sings well, the crowd gets into the performance by clapping, cheering and dancing.  If the performance is bad, the audience becomes bored and the user can get booed off the stage.Single Player Game Modes include:

Arcade Mode: where users sing 3–5 songs and try to score big points
Showtime Mode: Players start at a living room party and work to a huge concert at the Enormobowl.  Additional venues include: a subway station, The Pit Stop, a county fair, the Superstar TV show, Club Avalanche, and a royal hall.
Karaoke Mode: Players can enjoy singing the song without having to worry about bring rated or scored.

Multi-player Game Mode include:

Arcade Mode: 2–8 players perform songs and try to be the player with the highest score at the end of each round.  The player who wins the most rounds is the winner.
Karaoke Competition: 3–8 players compete against each other.  The main twist of this mode is that each player rates the performance of the other players to determine the winner of the Karaoke competition.

In comparison to the PlayStation 2 version, the gameplay mechanics stay the same, but the storyline (which takes place in 2011 instead of 2007) and the 15 levels are different.The gameplay has been simplified in comparison to its predecessor. While the player is still in command of a squad for most missions, he no longer sets way points to the individual soldiers. Instead he simply moves the cursor to a location and activates a context-sensitive command list or gives general movement commands. There is only one squad instead of two and the player can't switch to another squad member.The gameplay itself mostly involves shooting enemies, but it is important to find out the correct tactical approach for every encounter. This is made easier with the save system which allows to save at every time.

Playing as Sonny Crockett or Ricardo Tubbs, the player must dismantle drug-lord Ortega's organization, following the plot of an episode of the series.Through 14 missions, the player must take down (or arrest, sometimes) drug dealers and solve some minor puzzles (like finding keys to open doors, or switching levers to get access to locked places). In some stages, the player can choose freely to play as Crockett or Tubbs, switching between them by the click of a button. They have different abilities (Tubbs, for instance, is tougher and can kick in doors, Crockett is more agile), and different weapons (Crockett has a pistol as primary weapon, Tubbs has a double barreled shotgun). The characters can also carry a secondary weapon, from among 14 types (9mm pistols, .45 pistols, silenced 9mm, Uzi-like sub-machineguns, etc.). Each character can use only certain types of weapon, Tubbs carrying usually the heavier ones. The primary weapons have unlimited ammo, the secondary ones don't.In the stages where the player can choose either Crockett or Tubbs, basic commands can be given to the secondary character, such as asking for following the partner or covering him. The characters will heal themselves as the time passes, and they can heal each other: if one of them dies, the other can revive him.The characters can interact with the environment: whenever an action is possible, an icon will appear, showing which action can be taken, such as opening (or breaking) doors, climbing ladders, etc. Jumping is part of those particular actions, as the characters can only jump at specific places where the proper icon shows up. As for other actions, characters can run, crouch, walk and lean against walls.

The Jedi Order is nearly exterminated. A mysterious ex-Jedi has been exiled from the Order and is traveling alone. This Jedi had served under Darth Revan (when the latter was still on the Light side of the Force) during the Mandalorian Wars, but due to enigmatic circumstances was forced to retire. Now the past is catching up with the Jedi, and soon he or she will have to choose the side to fight on.The Sith Lords looks and plays very similarly to its predecessor, also being based on the Star Wars d20 role-playing rule set (which, in its turn, is similar to the 3rd Edition of Dungeons & Dragons) and having the same combat engine, character development, and a Light and Dark ethical system, which judges the player's decisions and actions and influences story events and characters' responses. Additions to the gameplay include a lightsaber-crafting system, which allows augmenting lightsabers with various items, new Force powers, and the possibility to influence the alignments of the characters in the player-controlled party through conversation choices and other decisions. Most of the exploration and the combat sequences is done using a party of three, including the protagonist and two companions. However, certain parts of the game will force the player to travel alone, or to control a party made exclusively out of companions.A large part of the military equipment can be upgraded using any workbench that can be found throughout the game world, including one available at all times on the ship that the player uses to travel between planetary systems. Different types of items have more than one piece that can be augmented. For example, the armor has two slots for upgrades (overlay and underlay), while ranged weapons have three (targeting, firing chamber, and power pack), and lightsabers have six. The easiest way to get additional upgrades is to either buy them or loot them, however they can be created as well at a workbench with the right components and enough repair skill. Medical items are a different sort and they can be crafted using lab stations.At various moments during the game, the player has the opportunity to play some mini games: a card game called Pazaak, shooting targets using a turret from a first-person view, and swoop racing.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2004-12-14</td><td>Ubisoft, Inc.</td><td>369 Interactive</td><td>Adventure, Compilation</td><td>1st-person</td><td>Licensed</td><td>Crime, Detective / mystery</td><td>Puzzle elements</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This game is named for and based upon the CBS television series CSI.

Eventually, Choi Song orchestrated his own father's assassination, took control of North Korea, and severed ties with the outside world. Then the Australian Navy intercepted a North Korean freighter carrying nuclear weapons intended for sale to terrorist cells. In response, China, South Korea, the Allied Nations send troops into the troubled region to topple Song's regime.

Each of the mercenaries also speaks different languages, which makes him or her more or less suitable for work with particular factions.Players have free reign of a massive landscape to take bounties on the "Deck of 52", a list of most wanted people in General Song's regime. Four factions have moved in to take advantage of the coup for personal gains; each faction will offer the player resources such as vehicles and supplies, as well as missions that the player can use to make money.

When he hears that a town populated by Grubbs has been invaded by a demon, the Stranger ventures there. The town was once protected by a race of creatures known as the Steef, who now appear to be completely extinct. The Stranger soon discovers that a nearby river has been dried up by a dam, built by a person called Sekto. The Stranger must confront this person as he continues to hunt down outlaws, revealing nothing about his past.Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath is set in the fictional Oddworld universe, differing in many ways from the preceding installment. The game incorporates two basic genres: third-person platforming action and first-person shooter. The player can switch between the modes at any time by using a melee or a ranged weapon, respectively. The goal of the game, for the most part, is to bag the outlaws and bring them in, collecting "moolah" (the game's currency) in the process. The Stranger can stun or knock down enemies, as well as use a stealthy approach, e.g. hiding in long grass to surprise the enemy.The Stranger's weapon is a double-barrel crossbow, upon which the player can load up to 81 combinations of "live ammo".  Literally, the ammo is alive, from the wise-cracking ChipPunk, to the explosive BoomBat.  These critters live in the wild, and can either be bought in bulk at centrally located stores run by the chicken-like Clakkerz in town, or can be hunted in the wilds.Missions are selected by the player when they accept bounties at the Bounty Store. To help steer them in the right direction, the Clakkerz that are walking around town will offer bits of sometimes helpful, but always sarcastic conversation when the protagonist communicates with them. Moolah can be spent to upgrade weapons, ammunition, and armor, as well as acquire various items.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">World Soccer: Winning Eleven 8 International</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-02-01</td><td>Konami Digital Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo, Inc.</td><td>Sports</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Managerial / business simulation</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The new Pro Evolution Soccer has over 3000 licensed players,

The last rehash of the engine debuted on FIFA 2003, it draws most of it's gameplay elements from the 2005 edition, but with some changes to gameplay such as a slightly more aggressive AI on attack (reducing the need to constantly push players forward using the Off The Ball controls, still present), new refereeing aspects such as some deliberate errors (as in occasional bad offside calls or throw-ins, not cheating the player through mistakes),  advantage rule and handballs and a new set piece system, which replaces the much criticized "targeting" and "push and shove" featured in 2005. This system is much less rigid and less formulaic, as a directional arrow and powerbars define how balls are crossed and there are four player movement setups, thus making each corner and indirect free kicks different. For direct free kicks, players have the option to take driven or curved shots or drop a pass to a nearby player to explore a gap in the defense. All options are available at all times, instead of being determined by the distance to goal. 
Many of these changes were later adapted into the new FIFA 06 engine, and it was also chosen as the match engine for subsequent Bright Future's  FIFA Manager. The presentation takes notes from real television broadcasts, with goals, fouls and attempts on goal being recapped not only in the full-time highlight reel but also during game stoppages and PiP popups. As the game is presented in a faux letterboxed format, next to the scoreline some statistics occasionally popup, allowing to keep track of them for some missions. A very requested feature, the ability to see the energy bars of the closest players to the ball of both teams, was finally included, as well as icons for the special abilities (speed, shooting, dribbling or tackling) of the best players.The Champions League, where the player leads one team to the Final in the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, in the quest to succeed FC Porto as European Champions, is one of the available modes, but not the most important. That honour goes to the "The Season" mode, where the player starts by creating his managing avatar, and then proceeds to a a series of 50 missions, with the first being a close last-week match against a Champions League spot rival, proceeding with a buyout of the club and increased expectations, and (hopefully) closing with the Champions League final.  This mode also allows players to unlock additional features such as balls, a stadium and special exhibition modes by fulfilling objectives set by the club president during the season, some of them crucial matches (which can result in a sacking if  failed), others simply a matter of balancing the squad. Other modes include the usual friendlies, "home and away" (a two-legged friendly), scenarios (where the player can create situations such as a defending a 1-0 nil for 45 minutes while two man down) and practice.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">NBA Street V3</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-02-08</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Electronic Arts Canada</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Tricks / stunts</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Bring your game to the street in EA's third installment of the NBA Street franchise.

He utilizes a number of holy weapons and artifacts, from twin revolvers (dubbed the Witch's Curse) that shoot stones from the Holy Lands to Holy Water Bombs and the Cross Shotgun. Constantine can also utilize various kinds of offensive magic powered by the souls of slain demons. Often he will be obliged to travel to Hell, which resembles a perpetually ablaze and decaying version of our world, in order to bypass obstacles. Each level is linear and is played sequentially, following most of the story of the movie with a few sections added in or stretched out to allow for more action. Hidden cards in levels will unlock cutscene animatics, concept art, and interviews with the stars of the film.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Dai Senryaku VII: Modern Military Tactics</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-02-16</td><td>Kemco</td><td>SystemSoft Alpha Corporation</td><td>Strategy</td><td>Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Turn-based</td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Dai Senryaku VII: Modern Military Tactics is a Turn Based Strategy game (TBS).

These clones are trained for battle and to fight for the Galactic Republic, trained in specific talents and abilities. One such specialization is Delta Squad, a group of four commandos trained for ground combat, recon work and outfitted with bacta healing implants. Delta squad is composed of four members: RC-1138 ("Boss"): the squadron leader bred for tactics, RC-1140 ("Fixer"): a computer cracker, RC-1207 ("Sev"): a hunter and marksman, and RC-1262 ("Scorch"): a demolitions specialist. Delta Squad and the rest of the clone army are deployed to their first battle, on the planet Geonosis.Star Wars: Republic Commando is a first-person squad-based shooter set in the Star Wars universe with tactical squad gameplay. Players take the roll of Boss, the leader of Delta Squad. Like most first-person shooters, the emphasis in gameplay is on action. Republic soldiers use a standard gun weapon, the "Blaster", in order to shoot opponents in front of them. Blasters can be attached to perform three different functions, with individual ammunition: a standard fiting mode, a sniper mode and an anti-armor mode. Players also carry a smaller energy pistol that automatically charges itself. New weapons can be found from a defeated enemy or found lying around on some levels, however only one may be carried at any given time. Some player weapons allow zooming functions for more accurate firing. The player also carries 4 different types of grenades, which are: thermal detonators (basic blast), sonar detectors (limited proximity detection), electrostatic charges  (disables electronics and droids) and flash detonators (blinds foes). All of which can be thrown directly in front of the player. Each member of Delta Squad has a personal shield that automatically recharges after a short time and a health bar which can only be replenished by healing bacta. Bacta is found at appropriate dispensers throughout the levels, and additionally each member of the squad carries an emergency bacta device to "revive" any member of the squad who falls in battle. Should the player be the one to lose all health, they watch the level from a hazed view and can issue a last order for other squadmates to try and revive them. Should all 4 members of Delta Squad fall in battle, the game is over.The main feature of Republic Commando is the 4-man squad. Using a "one-touch" control system, the player gives orders to members of the squad. The first type of command is for setting the squad's attitude: Search and Destroy (move forward), Form Up (stay close), Hold Position, and Recall from any assigned positions. The other type of orders are done by highlighting different positions displayed on the player's HUD and assigning a Delta member to perform the appropriate action. All of these positions are pre-defined in the level, with only a single action being possible. Examples of positions include: Cover for a sniper, barriers which need to be destroyed, turrets that can be mounted and used to attack the enemy, mines which can be disarmed, control panels which can be hacked, etc. Despite the hint of specialization designations and character personalities, any squad member, including the player, can be used to perform any action.Multiplayer functionality includes regular deathmatches and capture the flag. There are no squad-based commands in multiplayer, though players may be placed on individual "teams" to work towards their goal.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Worms 3D</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-03-01</td><td>SEGA Corporation</td><td>Team17 Software Limited</td><td>Strategy</td><td>1st-person, Behind view, Top-down</td><td></td><td>Comedy, War</td><td>Artillery</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control, Multiple units/characters control</td><td>Turn-based</td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">As depicted very well by the title of the game, the infamous quarrelsome Worms are squirming for the first time in full 3D.
The goal of the game hasn't changed a single bit from its predecessors: the objective is still to crush, annihilate and put into oblivion the worm team of the enemy using massively-wacky weapons of destruction. About all the features of its original 2D ancestors are also present, including random wind and a fully destructible landscape.Not all the weapons that were previously available have made the cut into the 3 dimensional realm, however Worms 3D comes too with a selective set of new weaponry such as the Lottery Strike or the Gas Grenade which should allow you to find a few dozen of new ways to kill your fellow worms online.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">American McGee presents Scrapland</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-03-07</td><td>Enlight Interactive Inc.</td><td>Mercury Steam Entertainment S.L.</td><td>Action, Racing / Driving</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">American McGee presents Scrapland is a third-person 3D action game set on an asteroid called Scrapland, a ruined paradise rebuilt by robots, the only inhabitants now. The player controls D-Tritus, a self-constructed young robot that has just arrived in Chimera, the main city. The adventure begins when he accepts a job as journalist and strange things start to happen...The game is a mix between free-form outdoor levels and indoor levels with combat and puzzle-solving elements. During said indoor levels, the player can instantly change his form between 14 robots, all with their own advantages and special abilities. Utilizing those robots is important to solve puzzles or mini games, e.g. only a tiny robot can fit into small spaces and only certain robots are allowed into some areas. However, those disguises can be seen through by certain enemy types. Then it is a good idea to change to a robot with fighting abilities - aiming is basically done automatically by the game.The outdoor levels can be freely explored, but there is not much more to do than flying to next the mission objective or indoor level. The parts of the spaceship can be upgraded individually; better parts are gained during the game and by solving optional missions. The player can have up to nine different spaceships and switch between them as needed - a heavy one is better suited for fights while a small one is useful for races.Additionally, the game features various outdoor areas which can be started outside the campaign and three multiplayer modes.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Robots</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-03-07</td><td>Vivendi Universal Games, Inc.</td><td>Eurocom Developments Ltd</td><td>Action</td><td>Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Platform</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">A gifted young inventor, Rodney Copperbottom, moves to the big city to realize his dreams of working for his childhood hero, Bigweld.

The combat system is similar to the earlier games based on that series, but unlike them, it is a competitive vs. fighting game.  It is not a traditional one-on-one fighter, but an arena-based, four-player game - somewhat along the lines of Power Stone.There are two game modes. There is a single-player adventure mode in which you must guide one of ten characters (including six unlockables) through a series of 100 bouts that have you either beating up enemies, or, in a few cases, dodging bombs for a set amount of time. Completion of these portions unlocks the additional characters, bonus characters and stages for melee mode.Melee mode is the multiplayer portion. It has ten basic and twelve unlockable characters, and nine basic and fifteen unlockable stages. There are four game types which mirror popular types from first-person shooters. There is a deathmatchesque knock-out mode, where the goal is to score the most KOs. (Players respawn after being KOed.) There is also a Last Man Standing mode, where the goal is to be the only player left when the others are KOed, a King of the Hill, where you must stand on a glowing patch of ground and defend it from other players, and a Keep away mode, where you must hold a treasure chest and avoid other players who are trying to beat you up and take it.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Worms Forts: Under Siege</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-03-15</td><td>SEGA of America, Inc.</td><td>Team17 Software Limited</td><td>Strategy</td><td>1st-person, Behind view, Top-down</td><td></td><td>Comedy, War</td><td>Artillery</td><td>Classical antiquity, Egypt (Ancient), Japan (Ancient/Classical/Medieval), Medieval</td><td></td><td>Direct control, Multiple units/characters control</td><td>Turn-based</td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Worms Forts: Under Siege is a turn-based strategy game where 2 – 4 people battle it out with a team of 4 worms with the help of weapons and forts. Each player takes timed turns bombing, shooting, causing natural and unnatural disasters, punching and blowing up the opponent’s worms. Each worm has a set amount of health and once that health is depleted or the worm drowns that worm is dead.New to the series is the ability to construct buildings to aid in the fight. Build hospitals to resurrect dead worms, science labs to increase your firepower, strongholds to base your operations in and protect your worms, towers, keeps, castles and citadels to deploy weapons from their tops and weapon factories to produce multiple weapons around them at the start of each turn you take. Along with these typical buildings you can create Wonders which your opponent has two turns to knock down and if they don’t succeed you win. If they in turn build their own you must destroy it to win the game.Along with the typical Worms-style weapons like the mini gun, bazooka, rocket launcher, earthquake and homing pigeon (a homing missile in the form of a pigeon), you will also have weapons to destroy buildings like the trebuchet, fridge launcher, nuclear strike and the Trojan Donkey (which you get to place where you like and it remains there until it explodes, how long it takes to explode is not known). Some weapons like the Old Women and Rhino can be steered to your desired location upon which they explode on contact, or they can be exploded early by pressing a button.Throughout the game different crates will fall from the sky or teleport onto the playing field. There are four different types of crates: weapon crates (more powerful weapons); health crates (increase the health of a wounded or sick worm); utility crates, which carry instant utilities such as spy (see contents of all crates on the field), double time (doubling the time for your turn) and double damage (for one turn inflict double the damage); and collectible utilities like freeze (freeze your worms or buildings to protect them from damage for one turn), parachute (so your worm can safely jump from heights), jet pack (to reach distant locations and heights) and repair (to fix damaged buildings). Single play allows for a quick game, tutorial, campaign, the trials (death match against the CPU) and the viewing gallery, which allows you to view movies you have unlocked in the game by winning matches, see how much of the game you have completed, check out the credits and look through the Fortapedia (a list of buildings available in the game and their descriptions).As with the other Worms games, in multiplayer you have a plethora of options to choose from to set up a match against other people including allowing the CPU to play. Choose schemes (selection of pre-set weapons and game options), landscapes (the type of playing field – Roman, Egyptian, Samurai and Old World), Fortpot (a slot machine that randomly selects three game options from the many available), game settings (wins required, turn time, etc.), worm health and sudden death settings.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Rugby 2005</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-03-18</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>HB Studios Multimedia Ltd.</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Rugby 2005 is the first update to EA Sports' rugby franchise.

The player controls one of two characters - Narcotics detective Jack Forezenski (voiced by Michael Madsen), or D.E.A. agent Marcus Hill (voiced by Bill Belamy). Both are led by Narcotics chief Joe Kowalski (voiced by Ron Pearlman), and the player switches between the two as the story unfolds.As an undercover cop, players are free to roam the streets and dispense justice at their discretion. Aside from storyline missions, players can encounter 12 types of randomized street crimes and stop them to boost their "badge rating" (loosely, a measure of their trust within the police). Players can likewise flash their badge around to cause perps to surrender or run. Criminals that resist must be beaten in a small "struggle" minigame to get cuffed. Players can also arrest alleyway drug dealers and deposit their drugs safely at the station.Alternatively, the player can beat up drug dealers for their cash and stash, then sell the drugs to civilians for income. The player can also use the drugs themselves for temporary beneficial effects (ecstasy keeps enemies from attacking, speed makes you run and shoot faster, etc.) at the cost of badge points and the potential to become addicted. Excessive use of force against innocent civilians, or selling drugs to other undercover cops, result in major losses of badge points.Players have a maximum badge rating of 100.  If it drops below 49, they are demoted to Patrolman and cannot take new story missions. The player must roam the streets in their police blues and stop enough random crimes to be moved back to Narcotics. If the player's rating drops below 24, they are kicked off the force and rendered jobless.  Jobless players cannot fight or shoot  weapons without attracting police attention. Further drops in rating cause the player to be wanted by the police, with a rating of 5 or lower spawning officers specifically to shoot or arrest the player.There are 25 hidden drug stashes in each city. Finding all of them will unlock the original N.A.R.C. arcade game for play.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">TimeSplitters: Future Perfect</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-03-21</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Free Radical Design Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In the year 2401 the space marine Sergeant Cortez is leaving the space station that he visited in the end of his previous journey.

The creation of this force is seen as a violation of international law and Japan's constitution, and it causes tensions to rise between Japan, China, and North Korea. In time, North Korea and China set up shipping blockades around Japan, and Japan calls on the United States for help, citing article nine of the Postwar Constitution. Throughout this time, Japan uncovers more and more information that the infamous Black Gold Day was caused by intentional information warfare attacks. As the U.S. prepares to launch the USS Clarence E. Walsh, Third Echelon sends the famous Sam Fisher on a mission that appears to be unrelated to the incident, but which may end up being the most important element of it all.In Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, players take on the role of field operative Sam Fisher for a third outing. Fisher has some new moves this time around, and he also has a new weapon always at his disposal; a combat knife. Utilizing the knife, Sam can either kill his enemies, or simply knock them out. At the end of each mission, the player is given an overview of how they did. The more people that the player spares, the better the success score.The single-player game is more open-ended than the past two Splinter Cell games. While players are still forced through some areas in a "tunnel" like fashion, with no choice of where to go, there are many instances where they can decide how they'd like to get there. For example, in the caverns, one can either kill two enemies and cross the bridge, or leave them alone, sneak along the side path, and climb a ladder at the end, bypassing the fight entirely, but still winding up in the same location.Throughout the game many different locations are visited, such as a lighthouse, a Japanese tea house, Seoul, New York City during an East Coast blackout, and other such exotic locales.The Spies-vs-Mercs multiplayer mode that appeared in the previous game has returned, with some new features. There are several new, large maps to play on, as well as updated versions from the past game.

Players take control of over thirty characters to play through key moments from The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. The storyline includes most of the important events in the movies, omitting or adding a few sequences. The presentation of these events, however, is humorous, with all the characters and environments made out of LEGO bricks. Objects would often break apart like physical LEGO bricks, characters have comical expressions, and all dialogue from corresponding events from the movies is replaced by gestures.The basic gameplay is action with platforming and light puzzle-solving elements. Players navigate two or more characters through stages, each representing a chapter in a movie. These chapters must be unlocked in a plot-dictated order, eventually completing the entire movie. Characters use different weapons (blasters, lightsabers, crossbows, etc.), and each character type also possesses specific abilities. For example, Jedi can use the force to lift, combine, and destroy objects; robots can unlock encrypted doors; other characters may use a grappling hook to access higher platforms, etc. Some of these abilities overlap (i.e. a problem can be solved in more than one way), though often a specific type of character is required to deal with the situation. In the single-player mode, one player can switch between the available characters; in the co-op mode, two players navigate at least two different characters.A few levels involve players piloting aircraft, fighting hostile vehicles, overcoming obstacles or destroying targets on the ground. The Free Mode allows players to access previously visited stages with any characters they have unlocked. This may lead to a discovery of previously inaccessible areas. Various collectible items and LEGO studs (which serve as currency) can be gathered during exploration. Characters cannot permanently die in the game; when a character is killed, he or she only loses collected LEGO studs.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Red Ninja: End of Honor</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-03-30</td><td>Vivendi Universal Games, Inc.</td><td>Tranji Studio</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Regional differences</td><td>Martial arts</td><td>Stealth</td><td>Japan (Ancient/Classical/Medieval)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td>Free-roaming camera</td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The game is set in medieval Japan, at the time of "warring states". Shingen Takeda and Nobunaga Oda clans are fighting each other, trying to gain supremacy over the entire Japan. The heroine of the game is a young girl called Kurenai ("crimson"), the daughter of a prominent Japanese engineer whose new invention (apparently, a destructive weapon) has drawn the attention of the warring clans. Ninjas sent by Nobunaga Oda attack his workshop, kill him, and leave Kurenai hanging from a tree tied by tetsugen, a piece of wire used by ninjas as a weapon. But a kind woman saves Kurenai, and trains her to be a ninja herself. This is where her quest for revenge begins."Red Ninja" is an action game with stealth elements. The primary weapon Kurenai uses is the deadly tetsugen. During the game you'll learn to perform new moves with this weapon. You can also use other weapons, such as a blowgun and throwing knives. Kurenai can jump, hang from ledges, and roll. There is a fair amount of platform-like sequences where she will have to demonstrate her acrobatic ninja technique. An effective way to kill enemies is to use stealth. Kurenai can approach enemies silently and hide behind objects. She can also "seduce" enemies, by talking to them in a sexy way and luring them to their death - a move that doesn't always work.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">DOOM³</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-04-05</td><td>Activision Publishing, Inc.</td><td>id Software, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td>Horror</td><td>Shooter</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The third game of the DOOM series (now in full 3D) takes gamers through the depths of Hell, where technology and demons meet.

Returning to the game is the super slow motion that was originally employed in  Max Payne games and The Matrix movie. You can now use Shadow to attack enemies in real-time while you beat down on other enemies.

Master Li explains that the leader was a member of the Lotus Assassins, a special force serving the Emperor of the Jade Empire, who also happens to be his brother. The student is revealed to be the last in the line of Spirit Monks, whose abode was destroyed several years ago by the Emperor's army. The student ventures into a nearby cave to retrieve a part of an ancient amulet; meanwhile, the assailants burn down the town and abduct Master Li. The student and a few companions decide to go all the way to the Imperial Capital and explore the Jade Empire in order to rescue the master, find the truth about the past, and discover the dark secrets of the Empire's rulers.Jade Empire is a role-playing game set in a fantasy world which has strong similarities to China of the Qing dynasty (within some steampunk elements), incorporating not only classical elements of Chinese culture, but also supernatural beings and forces. Similar to other BioWare RPGs (such as Knights of the Old Republic) in general concept and features, the game has overall simpler gameplay and a somewhat smaller world.The combat in the game is action-based, relying on various martial art techniques and moves performed by the protagonist. The player has direct control only over the main character, although other characters join the party; one of them can be selected to help the protagonist in battles, either for purely supportive purposes or as an additional combatant. The player character has three attributes: Body, Mind, and Spirit, which control the secondary parameters of Health, Focus, and Chi, as well as the conversation skills Charm, Intuition, and Intimidation. Focus energy is needed to fight with weapons (swords and staves), while Chi is used to heal the protagonist or perform supernatural attacks comparable to magic spells. Experience points are obtained from completing quests and vanquishing enemies, and allocated by the player to increase the protagonist's aforementioned attributes.Quest and conversation system bears more similarities to previous BioWare RPGs than combat and character customization. There are many side quests in the game, some of which can be solved through dialogue, applying the main character's conversation skills. Many quests, including plot-related ones, can be solved in different ways. The protagonist may embrace either of the two major philosophies of the Jade Empire, Way of the Open Palm or Way of the Closed Fist, roughly corresponding to "good" and "evil" ideologies, respectively. Pursuing one of these ideologies rather than hesitating between the two may award the player character with various bonuses. The protagonist can also romance some of the companions, including same-sex relationships.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Jade Empire (Limited Edition)</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-04-12</td><td>Microsoft Corporation</td><td></td><td>Special edition</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The Limited Edition of  Jade Empire adds a new default playable character, monk Zeng, with the exclusive Monk Spade fighting style.

The boy, named Raz, is allowed to stay at the camp until his father comes to pick him up, but his arrival coincides with very strange circumstances. Soon, evidence that someone is psychically tampering with the campers' minds reveals itself, and Raz is the only one who can stop it. Raz must project himself into the psyches of several different people in order to figure out what is going on and who is behind the recent occurrences.Psychonauts is a 3D platform game with a rather unorthodox style. The characters' inner worlds are the game's levels. Each world reflects the personality of the person whose psyche it represents, often resulting in unique, surreal creations, and influencing the gameplay style. For example, the psyche of a giant lungfish is presented as a large city populated by fish people, in which Raz himself becomes a giant monster who can destroy entire buildings; the psyche of a mental patient is a huge board game, where Raz has to command armies in order to defeat Napoleon, etc.There are also many gameplay elements and tasks which are common for all the levels. These include Raz fighting the (not very numerous) regular enemies, defeating level bosses, collecting currency, "figments of imagination" needed to upgrade his powers, and bonus items such as complete sets of the character's memories and others. Many of the game's puzzles require the usage of psychic powers, which Raz obtains in a more or less strict order. These powers range from combat abilities such as Psy Shield to Telekinesis (moving objects without touching them) and Clairvoyance (reading other people's minds). The camp itself serves as the game's "hub", in which the player can explore, interact with characters, search for secret areas and items, and so on.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Stolen</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-04-19</td><td>Hip Games</td><td>Blue52 Games Limited</td><td>Action</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td>Spy / espionage</td><td>Stealth</td><td>Cyberpunk / dark sci-fi</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">You play as Anya Romanov, a thief living in a not too distant future.

It is also famed as the subject of many UFO conspiracy theories. Area-51, the game, is a first-person shooter (FPS) set in this particular base, now infested with rampant aliens and a mutagenic virus that changes your character. As Ethan Cole, Special Forces, specialist in the HAZMAT (hazardous materials) Division, you have to discover what's going on inside the base and blast the menace to save the world. Your character races against time: the same virus that is mutating the facility personnel into monsters is also in his organism, slowly transforming him into an inhuman creature under the control of the alien masterminds.The hero has access to more than ten types of human and alien weapons to fight the creatures. They are designed by Stan Winston Studios, monster creator for such films as Aliens, Jurassic Park and Predator. The weapons can be used in melee combat as well, and it's possible to switch to an alternate firing mode, in some cases with the downside that it consumes more ammo. Ethan can also use a scanner to investigate items of interest, documents, alien artifacts and residue. The information contributes to the backstory and is stored in the scanner's databank.At a specific point in the game, you will gain the ability to mutate into a creature for a limited time. All monsters and humans are then highlighted by your thermal vision, and you can use claws in melee and shoot heat-seeking parasites. Staying in the mutant form consumes mutagen, which can then be replenished by draining infected corpses, killing enemies in melee or consuming special syringes with mutagen, as opposed to using normal medical syringes to restore health.Area-51 has a two-player split-screen and an online multiplayer (for up to 16 players) component with several modes including Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Capture and Hold, and Infection. In Infection, all but one player start as normal healthy soldiers hunting one mutant player. The latter is able to create more mutants by killing opposing players, and thus infecting them.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Predator: Concrete Jungle</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-04-26</td><td>Sierra Entertainment, Inc., Vivendi Universal Games, Inc.</td><td>Eurocom Developments Ltd</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">When a sweltering night arrives in the summer of 1930, New Way City is visited by a creature of extraterrestrial origin. He is not there it conquer or to make first contact; he is there to hunt, and his prey is Man. After taking on warring mobsters the Predator is shot in the eye and hastily escapes, but leaves some of his equipment behind. While attempting to escape from the city in his ship, rubble falls onto the wounded hunter and pins him in place. In a suicidal attempt at preventing his remaining gear from being pilfered by humans, the Predator causes his ship to self-destruct; However, he survives and is rescued by his clan-folk. By committing the grave taboo of allowing his prey to obtain Predator technology, the one-eyed Predator is exiled to a hostile desert planet.Fast forward one hundred years and the Predator, now known as Scarface, returns to the city of his botched hunting trip. New Way City has grown into the futuristic Neonopolis, where gangs still reign in terror. In order to regain his honor, Scarface must regain his captured hunting gear and will not let anyone stand in his way. Just like the natural variant, the concrete jungle is a competitive and unwelcoming place where only the fittest survive. Scarface faces brutal gangs, hulking robots, heavily armed soldiers, cyborgs, and even his own kin in his quest to retrieve his lost technology. The hunt is on.In Predator: Concrete Jungle the player assumes the role of Scarface, the dishonored Predator on trail of his stolen equipment. It is a 3rd-person action game where the player often has to resort to hand-to-hand combat. Players make use of various upgradeable weapons such as glaives, mauls, a combistick, and famous wrist blades to take on enemies of increasing difficulty and specific weaknesses. Projectile weapons include a spear gun that can pin enemies to walls and the notorious shoulder-mounted plasma caster. Scarface also has access to the iconic cloaking device and a helmet with thermal vision.

The FBI has shot down your ship while flying over planet Earth.  And it, quite literally, lands right on their doorstep.  After a series of FBI Agents swipe your ship, what option do you have other than to blow up everything in your path to get it back?Alien Hominid is a 2D side-scrolling shooter with heavy references to the Metal Slug series of games - from the hand-drawn graphics, huge explosions, right down to the ability to eviscerate FBI Agents when you get up close to them.  The graphics are by featured artist Dan Paladin.  Your goal, is quite simply, to get to the end of the stage, and die as little as possible.  Which is made difficult due to the fact that any bullet is an instant kill.To help you out, you can grab a range of power-ups, such as lasers, spread shots, shotguns, and more, as well as hijacking vehicles and using them for protection.  Grenades can be lobbed, and you can jump on enemy shoulders and choose to bite their heads off if you like, or pick them up and throw them at other enemies.  You can also dive underground for a short period of time to avoid enemies - while underground, you can drag agents into the ground to kill them.The GBA version of the game is identical in gameplay, however, with a few bosses removed (such as the robot bee and the FBI big-fisted tank robot).  The PlayStation 2, Xbox and Xbox 360 versions of the game include a special "PDA Game" with very simple-looking graphics.  Your goal in this game is to kill all the agents by hopping on their heads and then reaching the exit.

Gideon has a loving fiancée and life smiles. That is, until mysterious aliens appear. Gideon and his brother, a hero space pilot, are invited to the historical greeting party. Though the aliens are friendly, they come with a warning about another, vicious race, known as "the Seekers", who have decided to exterminate the human race. Soon after, the Seekers invasion begins, and so does the actual game.The game itself is a third person shooter with superpowers and a rudimentary melee fighting system. Alternatively, it's possible to switch to a first person perspective, although some abilities cannot be used in this view. Generally you just go around shooting aliens using a new kind of targeting system called flick-targeting. While on Xbox you select targets by tapping thumbsticks towards the foe you want to shoot, on PC this happens by scrolling the mouse wheel (although you can use the mouse for manual aiming and thus avoid scrolling through long list of enemies). You can also gain psychic powers to aid you in combat, ranging from lifting enemies into the air and slowing down time, to creating shields capable of deflecting attacks and smashing enemies with an electromagnetic pulse. These powers work like character upgrades, each one having five mastery levels. Jumping and melee fighting are also upgradeable. As part of the jumping mastery levels, for example, is dodging in slow motion. Just like weapons, in order to use powers they must first be equipped in at least one hand.During gameplay, the HUD shows Gideon's remaining health, the power meter, weapons and powers currently in use, and the number of rounds in the weapon. At first, you must find Nano Aid stations in order to recover health, however once Gideon gains mastery over his health, it simply regenerates if you stay out of harm's way. The power meter decreases every time a power is used, and if it's depleted you must wait for a time before you have access to your powers again.While Advent Rising is mainly a third person shooter, Gideon will have the chance to control the Scythe ATV, turrets and various alien ships. The game has four levels of difficulty (easy, normal, hard and ultra), and uses a checkpoint-based saving system.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Still Life</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-06-06</td><td>Adventure Company, The</td><td>Microïds Canada Inc.</td><td>Adventure</td><td>1st-person, 3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td>Detective / mystery</td><td>Graphic adventure, Puzzle elements</td><td></td><td></td><td>Point and select</td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Two separate murder cases, in two separate lifetimes -- so alike .. so similar in the smallest of details that one could believe they were performed by the same person.

Dino has been lenient, but this is the last straw - the garden needs some sweeping.Dino and Aliens is a 3D puzzle game with maze-like levels. The player controls Dino through short levels where the goal is to find and activate a portal to continue to a next section.

Unlike many licensed titles, this third-person action game in the vein of the Onimusha or Devil May Cry series only takes the base of its plot from the actual movie, then liberally changes it to make for better gameplay.Generally, the game brings in more content from the comic books than the movie, particularly considering the villains that appear. While the movie pretty much only concerned itself with Victor von Doom aka "Doctor Doom" as its supervillain of choice, the game brings in various characters from the comic books as well - the Mole Man, the Puppet Master, or Diablo, to name a few.The gameplay usually consists of walking the heroic title characters around a level and beating up the various enemies that cross their path. There are mission objectives, but usually, the only way to achieve them leads through the enemies, and just, as usual, the only way to fail them is to be overwhelmed by the Bad Guys. Beating up enemies yields points, which can be used to upgrade characters with new special moves or unlock various bonus materials.To spice it all up, developer Seven Studios have also thrown in a co-op mode that allows for playing the normal single-player mission in a tag team with a second player.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">KOF: Maximum Impact</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-06-28</td><td>SNK Playmore USA Corp.</td><td>Noise Factory, SNK Playmore Corporation</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td>Fighting</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The Addis gang, which has long controlled Southtown, has been struck a major blow.

You drive muscle cars around dirt tracks, battle them on destruction derby arenas, and take part in Ragdoll Olympics.  That last one may need some explanation.  When you crash in FlatOut, your driver (the Ragdoll) is flung through the windscreen, very much like in Rekkaturvat.  This feature is used in the Ragdoll sports where the task is to propel the hapless driver as far, as high, or as accurately as possible.  On the demolition arena the goal is to wreck other cars before yours is.  Simple as that.The bulk of the game is racing though and it can be performed in typical quick race and time trial modes in addition to the proverbial career mode.  There are also two different handling modes for the cars.  Normal mode gives arcade type handling, suitable for gamepads.  Professional mode seems to be designed for steering wheel owners and provides very challenging simulator-type handling.  Not surprisingly since Bugbear's previous racing title Rally Trophy was considered to be very challenging, even demanding, simulation.Bugbear's experience with simulation dynamics shows in FlatOut.  Almost everything on the track can be run into and it behaves as it should in real life.  Or at least as in a car-chase movie.  Stuff that cars scatter around are there on the next lap too and cars are gradually dismantled when hit to other cars or solid objects around the track.Multiplayer modes are of course great party hits.  Depending on platform, FlatOut has hotseat, split screen, LAN, and/or online multiplay modes.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-07-15</td><td>Global Star Software Inc.</td><td>High Voltage Software, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Puzzle elements</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">You play Charlie Bucket, a poor child, on a tour through eccentric confectioner Willy Wonka's fabulous candy factory in this interactive take on the classic children's story.As Charlie you will attempt to put the factory in working order, cleaning up the messes created by other children on the tour.

The game provides a set of different cars, characters and weapons you can play with. Weapons take a large part in the gameplay: It is quite impossible to win races without using weapons. There are alternate mission types such as escort missions, car bomb, police escape (the only mode without weapon), and others. There are also deathmatch modes where the goal is to get the maximum of frags on other cars in arena style maps. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">The King of Fighters 2003</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-08-25</td><td>SNK Playmore Corporation</td><td>SNK Playmore Corporation</td><td>Action</td><td>Side view</td><td></td><td>Martial arts</td><td>Arcade, Fighting</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The tenth installment in SNK's long running King of Fighters series, and the last KOF to appear on the Neo Geo system. This game's storyline focuses on the unexpected return of the Orochi power, who was thought to have been permenantly sealed away back in 1997 by Kyo Kusanagi, Iori Yagami and Chizuru Kagura. It appears that someone has been tampering with the seal, however...This year there are 30 characters, 2 edit characters (Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami) and 2 hidden characters (Kusanagi from KOF '02 and Chizuru Kagura) to choose from. There are several returning characters (Jhun Hoon, King, Shingo Yabuki, Hinako Shijou, Billy Kane and Ryuji Yamazaki) and few new fighters as well (Ash Crimson, Shen Woo, Duo Lon, Malin, Adelheid Bernstein and Mukai).Like The King of Fighters 2002, this game reverts back to the old 3-on-3 format used from KOF '94 to KOF '98. A new feature to this game that old-school KOF fans might have trouble getting used to is the new interchangeable team system. You still pick three characters and decide your character order before a match, but now you have the option to change to another character during a match. For example, if your character is low on power during a match, you can have either one of the other two characters at your disposal step in and take their place. It also works if you do not like the character that you have selected, or if you are having trouble using that character. You can change at any time during a match, but you cannot when two of your teammates have been taken out, and only one character is left in reserve.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Namco Museum: 50th Anniversary</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-08-27</td><td>Namco Hometek Inc.</td><td>Namco Limited</td><td>Compilation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone 10+</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Namco is honoring its 50th anniversary by releasing this compilation of arcade classics.

There are four skill levels, full varied weather effects, and all the real riders and bikes.It also adds a new Extreme mode to the experience. There are 16 Extreme tracks, each based in or near the locations of the real Grands Prix, giving the game a total of 32 tracks. These are generally faster than the real circuits, but they add hazards such as tight alleyways and bumpy cobbled roads. New customisable street bikes (both 2- and 4-stroke) are featured in the game, specifically for racing on the new Extreme tracks. Earnings in this mode are spent on bike upgrades.The on-line section of the game now utilises a seeding system to match riders with a similar ability together. Your seeding starts at 100, and reduces as you win races, depending on their difficulty. Turning the negative of releasing a 2004 season recreation well into 2005 into a positive, the X-Box version also includes some highlight footage of the real 2004 MotoGP season.The game also boasts a new Commentator Mode and Spectator Mode which allow non racing players to watch and comment on a race while they wait for a new game to start.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">NASCAR 06: Total Team Control</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-08-30</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>EA Tiburon, Point of View, Inc.</td><td>Racing / Driving, Simulation</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Automobile, Track racing, Vehicle simulator</td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">NASCAR returns with some new drivers and veterans (as in Jeff Gordan, Dale Earnhardt Jr. and etc), and all the tracks from the NASCAR circuit.

Once the tournament is down to the last 16, you move onto the "featured table", and once down to the last 8, you move onto the final table, where the winner will be decided.Several famous poker players make an appearance in game including Chris "Jesus" Ferguson, Men the Master and Jennifer Tilly.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Lockdown</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-09-06</td><td>Ubisoft, Inc.</td><td>Red Storm Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td>Shooter, Tactical shooter</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Lockdown is the third Rainbow Six game to appear on the consoles, this time with Red Storm Entertainment fully behind the wheel. Once again, you play as Domingo 'Ding' Chavez, leading a small commando team on black-ops missions. This time, however, the developer strays from the realistic squad-based action in favor of more arcadish gameplay. The main single player campaign is based around a dangerous virus and hostages. In certain missions, you play as sniper Dieter Weber, picking off terrorists from higher ground and providing cover while the team infiltrates the building.The differences between the console versions are the number of missions and the availability of certain gadgets. There is an offline two-player, split-screen cooperative mode available (up to 4 over Xbox live) and full online multiplayer up to 16 players featuring traditional deathmatch, objective-based games and CTF modes, on Xbox and PS2. While the PS2 version includes a Rivalry mode, Xbox online multiplayer has an RPG element: the P.E.C. mode (Persistent Elite Creation). Before playing, you choose an avatar and a class with specific abilities (commando, engineer, spec op and medic). While playing, you earn credits and experience, which can be traded in for new weapons, items or armour. Gear regularly needs to be repaired, shown by the durability level, and experience can be used to assign skills points to abilities, individualizing your character.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">NHL 2K6</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-09-07</td><td>2K Games, Inc.</td><td>Kush Games, Inc.</td><td>Sports</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Managerial / business simulation</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Everyone 10+</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Among the 2K6 edition's new features is the Crease Control, which allows you to take direct control of the goalie and slow everything down for a matter of seconds, giving you time to find where the puck is and prepare a save.NHL 2K6 has a complete feature set, including Franchise Mode, Exhibition, ProControl, On-The-Fly Coaching, the Enforcer system, and, of course, multiplayer over Xbox Live.Most of the rule changes adopted by the NHL following the lockout of the past season are incorporated into the game.All your teams are here, from the Toronto Maple Leafs to the Boston Bruins to the Ottawa Senators and the Tampa Bay Lightning.

The Pump It Up dance mat is different from the norm as the arrows are set on diagonals and includes a button in the middle which allows for more complexity in the dance moves that are required to be performed in the game.The general gameplay has the player watching a music video as symbols scroll by. The player must match the symbols on the screen with the symbols on the Pump It Up dance pad with their feet. Hitting the arrows in sync with the music will keep the players life bar up and give the player a good rating, while doing the opposite will drain the life bar and give bad ratings. If the life bar drains all the way, the game ends.The game has several mode to choose from:

Arcade Mode has the player trying to achieve an  “A” or an “S” rating on three consecutive songs. Doing that allows the player to play an extra song. Successfully completing songs in the Arcade mode opens them for play in Home Mode.
Home Mode allows the player to choose any song they have available to them.
Sudden Death Mode forces the player to perform a song flawlessly or the game ends. 
Survival Mode - This mode becomes available after the player completes twenty songs in the Home Mode. This is an endurance test for the player, as the game keeps giving the players songs to go through until their life bar is finally depleted.
Video Mode - This mode is unlocked after the player completes a total of twenty songs in either Home or Arcade Mode. It allows the player to just watch the videos for any song they've completed.
Tutorial mode - Teaches the player how the game works.

The game also keeps track of the players statistics (the rating grades they received for each song). The PS2 version of the game features 101 songs, while the Xbox version contains 97 songs, but offers the option to download more songs.  As some songs are more difficult then others, the game provides a rating from one to twenty to inform the player on just how hard of a task they are taking on by choosing a particular song.Two dance mats will be required for some songs that offer a freestyle option if the player chooses that setting. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Conflict: Global Terror</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-09-09</td><td>SCi Games Ltd.</td><td>Pivotal Games Ltd.</td><td>Action, Strategy</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Shooter, Stealth, Tactical shooter</td><td>Historical events</td><td></td><td>Direct control, Multiple units/characters control</td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This installment of the Conflict series occurs in many diverse regions of the world: in Conflict: Global Terror, Red Team spends the game fighting international terrorism.Rather than gung-ho desert tank warfare, or tense jungle ambush fighting, the game explores many non-army locations such as gas factories, cocaine production facilities and hotels.The combat is often up close and very personal, although most levels mix up the killzone areas, giving a wide variety of combat situations over many varying ranges. Missions vary quite a bit too. Some are frenetic and fast-paced, with the team fighting for their lives, while others can be played at a much slower pace if desired. The level design really adds to counter-terrorism gameplay. Red Team is often busting sieges using C4 to blow holes in walls and smoke grenades to flush the bad guys out.The gadgets are useful and are frequently found to be helpful: thermal goggles let the player see through smoke, and Bradley's laser designator can mark key targets for gunship air strike. Claymore mines allow the team to protect their rear or even set up ambushes.The game is very flexible and allows for many different playing styles. Players are free to run and gun, or play as a super-stealthy special forces team. They can play as one character leading the team, or switch around between characters as they see fit. Ordering the team about and switching characters is quick and simple. It is even possible to give each member advanced orders ("On my signal, Connors runs to the window, Bradley opens the door and Jones throws a grenade through the window. Ready... Go!"), allowing this kind of thorough planning if the player wants to play that way. The co-op allows multiple players to take control of Red Team.There are 4 difficulty modes and a skill learning curve for beginners and veterans alike. There are over 30 weapons with individual stats and behaviours. Each has their own distinct advantages and disadvantages. For example, pistols are sometimes a better choice than a light machine gun.The story unfolds throughout the missions and also in the cutscenes in between. The team is made up of four distinct characters, with their own personal histories, lives and personalities.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">NHL 06</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-09-09</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Electronic Arts Canada</td><td>Sports</td><td>Behind view, Diagonal-down, Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Managerial / business simulation</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Everyone 10+</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">New rules and updated rosters and season schedules feature in this update of the longrunning NHL series, as do many new features.Deking is now performed using the left analog stick, with swift signature moves of star players that confuse opponents and reward skill. The same stick is used to increase the accuracy when shooting. While preparing for a shot, a bull's-eye appears in the enemy goal and you can quickly move the target to the corners for precision. To add to the individual qualities, statistics such as speed and size are now reflected during gameplay in the players' momentum and turning radius. To get past opponents quickly, you can generate momentum for quick speed boosts.With the introduction of R.P.M. (Realistic Puck Momentum) dynamics, there is more randomness with the puck, as a shot off the mask can now stun goalies. Another small addition is the deformation of the ice during the match. In the player creation mode, where you can now apply bruises, broken noses, black eyes and scars to your players, the thumbstick is used for "face sculpting" - changing the different features.All the regular game modes are present, of which the Dynasty Mode from the previous version is the most complete, with scouting and full management options, inside and outside the arena. Contrary to the last game, you can now intervene during simulated AI games and win the match for your team.The PC, PS2 and Xbox version support online multiplayer games, and as a special bonus, the original NHL 94 game, one of the first in the series, has been included with the PS2 edition.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Pilot Down: Behind Enemy Lines</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-09-09</td><td>Oxygen Interactive</td><td>Wide Games</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td></td><td>War</td><td>Stealth</td><td>World War II</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Over 180,000 Allied airmen were shot down on enemy territory during WW2. This game is about one of those men, trying to get to safety of Switzerland through hostile territory.The gameplay is mostly about sneaking around varied environments such as a lumberyard, wilderness and so forth trying not to be detected by the German troops and making as little commotion as possible. With the aid of different objects (such as cigarette packs for distracting guards or apples for a quick stamina replenishing) the player must make it through the levels. The player character has a stamina which means that it's not very good idea to be standing in a freezing cold water for too long because if the stamina meter runs out, the health meter starts to deplete. Because of it, it's a good idea to warm up by campfires or eat something once in a while, thus restoring stamina.
Of course there is some weapons also, which one can use to dispatch enemies that wander too close. They range from a piano string to machine pistols.

MFM is a special effects company that creates monster costumes with a special formula they invented called, “Mubber”, that makes the costumes seems so real that the wearer literally becomes the actual monster.  When they arrive, they found the location in shambles.  Winslow Stanton, the creator of Mubber and owner of MFM, told them someone has stolen the Mubber formula and by using it with their animatrons, destroyed the building and disappeared.  He believes it is Jed’s doing because he, too, disappeared.  Looks like it’s up to Scooby and the gang to find Jed, destroy the costumed monsters and unmask the truth behind this great mystery!In Scooby-Doo! Unmasked, you will guide Scooby to help Mystery, Inc. uncover clues, fight monsters and occasionally save your friends from danger.  You will be visiting many several worlds including a China Town and a museum.  You will encounter various monsters like the Chinese Zombie and the Black Knight and the only way to get past them is by attacking them with your spin, slide, roll and smash attacks!  Also, by collecting mubbers, you can create special costumes that will give you special powers.  For example, with the Kung Fu Costume, you will be able to move around with greater agility and force. Be sure to watch your health level which is indicated by the number of Scooby Medals you have.  If you reach zero, you will restart at the last save point but you can restore your health by collecting enough Scooby snacks that can be found throughout the game.  Also, by collecting food items you can get Shaggy to cook you a special meal that will increase the total number of medals you have.In each world, when you’ve collected enough clues, Velma will ask you a few questions in order to figure out who is behind everything, and you must select the clues that you feel will answer these questions.  When that’s completed, you will have to fight a boss before Velma will reveal who the identity of the villain.Scooby-Doo! Unmasked can be saved at any point in the game simply by selecting Save Game in the Pause Menu.  You can also turn on the Autosave function which will enable the game to automatically save at different points.

This is emphasized by impact time, which shows crashes in all their slowed-down glory, and the boost you receive after a successful wrecking. Reckless driving bumps your Revenge rank, unlocking new events. This can also be achieved by medal placings that grant new vehicles.Collectible signature takedowns, crashbreakers (detonate your vehicle, now also in some regular races) and aftertouch for precise havoc remain, but one of the major changes is the ability to check traffic. Non-racing vehicles are no longer a nuisance with the sole purpose of slowing you down. They can now be actively used to obstruct traffic or send them into your foes. The Road Rage mode (take down a set number of rivals within a time limit) and Crash mode make a return, but Traffic Attack is new - race against the clock and level the traffic at the same time. Other modes include regular races, grand prix races, Burning Lap (high-speed time attack), Eliminator (last one after each round is out) and a normal time attack mode.In the Crash mode, the multipliers and bonuses have been removed, and you cannot drive at full speed towards a crossroads. You have to time your start to receive a proper boost and then it is only about steering, crashbreakers and aftertouch. There are many new tracks and cars, a soundtrack with lots of famous artists, and a new world tour in different countries.Online multiplayer is available for up to six players. New off-line additions are the split-screen Traffic Attack and a hot-seat Crash Tour for up to six players, next to the familiar Road Rage, Crash Party and Crash Battle modes.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Dynasty Warriors 5</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-09-13</td><td>KOEI Corporation</td><td>Omega Force</td><td>Action, Strategy</td><td>Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td>Hack and slash</td><td>China (Ancient / Imperial), Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The series returns for yet another iteration removing majority of the features included in Empires and Xtreme Legends.

In the basement, Dr. Reinhard experiments on unlocking the secrets of the Necromonicon. Using a helpless inmate named Sam as a test subject, the mad doctor frees the evil and once again Ash must live the nightmare as evil forces break free and inmates are turned into zombie deadites!Evil Dead Regeneration is a third person action game like The Suffering. Players control Ash, who fights with a variety of collectable weapons, which include the  trademark chainsaw-hand and shotgun, as well as a pistol, flamethrower, grenade launcher and a harpoon gun to pick up. For the most part, Ash will need to hack and shoot at various zombie creatures until their bodies become weak. At that point the player can press a button to have Ash unleash a finishing move using his weapons. Ash can also collect "evil essence" in order to turn himself into "Evil Ash", a more powerful version of himself.Also along on the quest is Sam, turned into a half-Deadite by Dr. Reinhard, he acts as Ash's sidekick in a quest for revenge. Sam can be controlled after finding certain "possession" symbols in the game. Ash can also kick Sam in order to attack enemies and activate puzzles.Ash is still voiced by Bruce Campbell while Sam is voiced by Ted Raimi.

It stars Tak (the hero from the first two games) and his brother Lok. The story is about how the people in Tak's village have set up a course of events for people to compete in. The game is a mixture of platforming and adventure. Tak and Lok have entered the event in hopes of winning. Introduced to this game is the ability to swap between characters with the touch of a butto or in 2 player mode you can play together in split screen. 
The characters have to reach various checkpoints to extend the level. All the levels take place in the various jungle settings of Tak's Village. The events consist of swimming, racing, climbing ropes, and other endurance challenges.Tak is the magic user while Lok is the brawn. During the game, the two characters provide comical banter with each other. Tak can use a chicken suit to fly and a lobster suit to swim underwater. The cutscenes are in real time. Taloc, the bad guy from the previous games, is nowhere to be found as the game now focuses on the Juju challenge and not on trying to defeat the bad guy. Patrick Warburton voices Lok.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Indigo Prophecy</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-09-20</td><td>Atari, Inc.</td><td>Quantic Dream SA</td><td>Action, Adventure</td><td>1st-person, 3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td>Adult, Detective / mystery, Horror, Thriller</td><td>Quick Time Events (QTEs)</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">January 2009. On a cold, snowy night in New York City, an ordinary citizen named Lucas Kane, under the control of an unknown force, unwillingly murders a complete stranger in a diner. Once he comes to senses, Lucas realizes he must escape while leaving as little evidence as possible behind. Barely managing to accomplish that, Lucas contacts his brother and tries to understand what has caused him to commit the crime, recalling the events of his own past in the process. Meanwhile, two police detectives investigating the murder, Carla Valenti and Tyler Miles, are determined to find the perpetrator, at the same time trying to deal with the personal problems of their lives.Indigo Prophecy (Fahrenheit in Europe) is a psychological thriller in which the player is able to control different characters on both sides of a murder - the killer and those who are trying to find him. The game's core gameplay style is adventure. The three protagonists explore various locations, talk to other characters, and interact with the environment in order to advance. However, the game is heavy on various action-oriented sequences, from tasks that must be completed within a limited amount of time to quick time events, which require the player to press the correct button during a scene.The game emphasizes realism in the player's interaction with the environment. For example, picking up a rag and cleaning the floor requires the player to  move the mouse or the analog stick back and forth, imitating the actual movements of the object. Dialogue with character often imposes time limits on the player; failure to choose the optimal response in time will prompt the game to choose another, not always the optimal one. The player's choice will sometimes influence the subsequent events and the outcome of the entire story, eventually leading it to one of the three possible endings.Cinematic treatment is evident in the game's handling of action-based gameplay and cutscenes, which are often seamlessly integrated into each other. An example of this is the split-screen technique, which is often used during the game's most dramatic moments: while the player is trying to complete the required action in time on one screen, another one displays what is happening around the controlled character.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Kingdom Under Fire: Heroes</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-09-20</td><td>Microsoft Game Studios</td><td>BLUESIDE Inc., Phantagram Co., Ltd.</td><td>Action, Role-playing (RPG), Strategy</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td>Real-time</td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This is the prequel to the action/RTS Kingdom Under Fire: The Crusaders for the Xbox. Six of the sub-characters from The Crusaders are now playable main characters in Heroes, along with one new character Walter. Each has its own story campaign.The gameplay is similar to the predecessor, featuring action, RTS, and RPG elements. The player controls several troops, ranging from basic types such as infantry, archers, spearmen, and cavalry archers; to more advanced ones like siege units, mortars, aerial bombers, wyverns, giant scorpions, and mammoths. In Heroes, there are also four new elemental troops: ice maidens, earth golems, thunder rhinos, and flame wraiths.The troops engage in RTS style combat, although commands are issued to entire troops instead of individual soldiers. When the troop led by the main character enters battle, the player fights in 3rd person action mode. Each of the seven playable characters has its unique set of attack moves and combos. Some are quick and agile; others like the ogre Urukubarr are slow but powerful.After each battle the player enters the World Map and upgrades all of his troops with new skills, weapons, and armor. Hiring different officers to lead troops gives them special magic abilities. The player moves to different locations in the World Map to engage in new battles.The multiplayer aspect has been significantly improved in Heroes to allow 3 on 3 strategy mode (The Crusaders supported 2 on 2), leader combat between only the playable characters, or co-operative mode against invasion from CPU-controlled troops.

His plan involves kidnapping mutants, and, with the help of the mad geneticist Mr. Sinister, extract their powers and use them to make himself even more powerful. At first, the heroes must rescue Professor X, who has fallen into the clutches of the enemy. However, when Apocalypse kidnaps Magneto's son Quicksilver, the leader of the Brotherhood is determined more than ever to team up with his former foes and stop Apocalypse's evil plans.X-Men: Legends II - Rise of Apocalypse is an action role-playing game and a sequel to X-Men Legends. The player controls a party of four characters, though only one at a time can be controlled directly. Beside switching the characters for combat purposes, the player is often obliged to do so, because some of the tasks in the game require the specific abilities of a certain mutant. For example, Iceman can put out fire, Magneto can generate a metal bridge across a gap, etc.. Most of the time, however, is spent in combat, collecting loot and acquiring experience points. Unlike the first game, items dropped by enemies are random. The character will level up, become stronger, and learn new skills. The player can opt to allocate all the experience and skill points manually.Each character has several different skills based on their mutant powers. These include melee, boost, projectile, traps, and others. Each character can also learn powerful super skill: for example, Cyclops has a super beam attack that can hit multiple targets; Wolverine has a spinning attack that inflicts heavy damage; Magneto has a metal attack, crushing everything in sight by manipulating metal objects in the environment, etc.New in the sequel is on-line multiplayer with both co-operative and six competitive modes.

You soon realize that you have been led you into a trap orchestrated by anti-perestroika KGB conspirators, headed by a fictional KGB director Named Georgi Barinski. These conspirators want  to stop you from uncovering their plans, and also get revenge for a previous news story in which you exposed a KGB operation in Berlin. To get you out of the way, they have switched your ordinary camera for one incorporating a cunning X-ray weapon, and have framed you as a CIA assassin who wanted to kill General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev (who, in the game, is somewhat incorrectly referred to as the "president" -- even though no such office existed at the time). Your goal is to escape the Lubyanka KGB prison, together with the head of the Presidential Guard, a loyalist named Grushkov who has also been framed. You must work with him to stop the KGB radicals from overthrowing the government, and to prove that you are both innocent.Cold War's gameplay is based on stealth, similar to games like Splinter Cell or Dark Project. Being a journalist you are no weapons expert, so you should try to be stealthy and attack only when necessary. To help even the odds, you can create useful gadgets out of items you find, improvising things like gas grenades, anesthesia ammunition or distraction items.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Far Cry: Instincts</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-09-27</td><td>Ubisoft, Inc.</td><td>Crytek GmbH, Ubisoft Entertainment Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Far Cry Instincts is an Xbox remake of the original Far Cry PC shooter, but with many changes and enhancements by Ubisoft Montreal, who collaborated with Crytek on this title.

While rescuing Valerie, you get revenge on the soldiers and scientists, and investigate the strange events on the island.The Xbox version is true to the original, but adds small twists to the plot (already in the opening scenes) and enhances the game with new gameplay elements. Jack has both offensive and defensive attacks. He can use boats, gliders, water scooters, ATV's and even a hovercraft to move around, and the weapons range from a butterfly knife to rocket launchers. While sneaking, you can use backstab, or branch whips and claymore mines as traps.New gameplay elements for the Xbox version are introduced when you are injected by doctor Richard Crowe. His serum gives you predator-like abilities. By killing enemies, resting, or taking physical damage, an adrenaline meter is filled, which can be used to activate feral abilities that enhance your instincts (hence the title) such as feral speed (extreme movement), feral vision (much like night vision), feral smell (trace enemies by odour) and feral strength to blast through doors.There are extensive multiplayer options, from split-screen behind a single console to system link with up to 16 consoles connected. Also on Xbox Live, the following modes are available:

Starting months before the events of the film, The Warriors expand and defend their Coney Island turf, while proving that they are heavy enough players to join The Riffs’ network.  With a citywide rep, they can get invited to a major gang meeting where the future of New York street crime will be decided.  The game follows the nine lead members of The Warriors (with flashback missions showing how they came to The Warriors): leader Cleon, Swan, Ajax, Cowboy, Cochise, Snow, Fox, Rembrandt, and Vermin.  During the game, the player will control each member, usually acting as a war chief and leading a squad of Warriors on a mission.  Missions vary from simply wrecking another crew to completing a series of objectives while avoiding arrest or worse. During missions, players can mug pedestrians, steal car radios, commit smash and grabs, tag walls or bomb other gangs’ burners, and load up on flash.  Between each story based mission, The Warriors return to their Coney Island hangout where they can train to improve their stats, go out on patrol, review their accomplishments, replay levels, or enter into a series of quick-play combat matches.  The game plays like a squad-based brawler.  Each Warrior has his own fighting style and much of the game environment can be weaponized.  Fights are fast and often brutal, but stealth is also an option.  Players can perform stealthy finishing moves and distract police or other gang members with thrown bottles.  The game’s environments are fully 3D allowing Warriors to escape along the rooftops, hop over fences, or dash into shadowy areas.

Impressive moves boost your Clash meter, which allows you to pull off unrealistic moves, such as easier running due to Bullet Time, and some brutally tough defences tackles.

Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth is a first-person action-adventure survival horror game, based on the H.P. Lovecraft mythos and his short story "The Shadow Over Innsmouth". Initially, CoC: DCotE plays like an adventure game, but soon it gains elements of a stealth game and of a first-person shooter. Notably, the game does not feature an on-screen HUD (not even a crosshair); Jack's health is hinted at by visual cues; as for ammo, you need to remember how much you have left before you'll have to reload. The health system used in the game is uncommon. There is no "hit points" system; rather, Jack receives minor or major wounds in specific parts of the body, and if he breaks a leg he's slowed down. To heal himself and prevent death from bleeding out, Jack can pick up medikits which contain bandages, splints, sutures and antidotes, each of which is used to heal a specific type of wound. Ill effects emerging from the wounds can be temporarily suppressed with a fix of morphine. Jack's sanity also plays an important role. When Jack looks at disturbing things or finds himself in alarming conditions, his vision blurs, he begins hearing voices and talking to himself. If this gets too bad, Jack may go insane or commit suicide. Also, Jack suffers from acrophobia, and looking down in high places will cause him vertigo. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">The Sims 2</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-10-24</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Maxis Software Inc.</td><td>Simulation</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td></td><td></td><td>Life / social simulation</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control, Multiple units/characters control, Point and select</td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This The Sims 2 version is a life simulator for console platforms allowing players to create incredibly deep characters with unique looks, clothes, aspirations, and personalities before taking them through all the intricacies of life.

Special tasks can be performed with gadgets, e.g. the laser watch or a small remote-controlled helicopter. This procedure gets spiced up with occasional driving or new jet pack sequences.The player gets rewarded for certain actions with bonus points, e.g. succeeding in melee combat or searching containers.

A Combine Citadel is erected in City 17, a town in Eastern Europe reminiscent of World War II ghettos. Dr. Wallace Breen, a human scientist, rules the city on behalf of his new masters. An energy field prevents humans from procreating, and no new children are born. Earth is turning into a grim, oppressive police state.Meanwhile, Gordon Freeman, the man who was at the center of the events that took place shortly before the rise of the Combine, awakens from his stasis and is inserted into a train to City 17 by the mysterious G-man. Gordon is soon brought into a resistance group and makes a seemingly futile attempt to bring down the Combine and liberate the Earth. Half-Life 2 is a linear first-person shooter with light puzzle-solving elements and many setpieces, similar to its predecessor in concept. The player guides Gordon Freeman through City 17 and the wilderness that surrounds it. On his way, he'll encounter a few friendly characters, but also fight dangerous foes. The game features a realistic physics system: Gordon can pick up objects and toss them freely, and many of the puzzles are physics-based - for example, at one point the player has to weigh down a seesaw with bricks at one end to turn it into a ramp. Gordon's enemies, apart from alien wildlife which found their way to Earth, are mainly Combine forces, which utilize a variety of firearms, gadgets, and vehicles. Policemen and foot soldiers work along with helicopters, gunships, and gigantic walking machines to hunt him down. To defend himself, Gordon has a range of weapons available: from the iconic crowbar for close-quarter fighting, through pistols and rifles, up to grenades and a rocket launcher. One of the most notable weapons is the gravity gun, with which Gordon can pick up objects, hold them in the gun's anti-gravity field, then hurl them at the enemy with great force. Setpieces in the game include coordinated assaults on enemy bases, fighting gigantic boss enemies, bringing down aircraft with the rocket launcher, and others. A few levels require the player to navigate buggy-type vehicles. Some of the more exotic stages involve the player summoning an army of antlions to unleash on unsuspecting foes.Included with the game is Counter-Strike: Source, a version of Counter-Strike made with the new Source engine which powers Half-Life 2, and Half-Life 2: Deathmatch, an online multiplayer game featuring the same physics and weapons as the single player game.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Need for Speed: Most Wanted</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-11-15</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Electronic Arts Canada</td><td>Racing / Driving</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Automobile, Street racing, Vehicle simulator</td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Need for Speed: Most Wanted is in fact a cross between the Underground and the Hot Pursuit spin-offs.

As in the original, the single-player campaign simulates a soldier's true Army career from boot camp all the way to the Special Forces. Most of the game's missions involve real-world situations today, and the game uses authentic Army weapons and equipment. The 35 unconnected missions are divided into five missions for each class.Since the game was developed with the professional advice of actual Special Forces soldiers, it is realistic and forces the player to follow authentic Army tactics. If players use a run-'n-gun approach to the gameplay, they can easily get killed on the battlefield. In multiplayer, the player's experience points determine which class he is able to take. There are two major changes to this console version. The "build-a-soldier" feature allows the player to fully customize a soldier by changing his name, nickname, face, and even his homestate. Experience points, which are earned at the end of each mission for performing well, can be spent improving the soldier's seven abilities. The experience from multiplayer and single player are separate.ScreenshotsThere are no Xbox user screenshots for this game.Promo ImagesThere are no promo images for this gameTrailerAlternate Titles "美国陆军：战士的成长" -- Chinese spelling (simplified)

It can be played in single-player or two-player coop mode. The game lets the player take part as a paratrooper in the allied campaign in Europe during the second world war, starting out as a private soldier from either the US 101st Airborne, the US 82nd Airborne, or the British 1st Airborne regiment.There are 40 missions strung together with a narrative, depicting the Operation Overlord (D-Day), Bastogne, Operation Market Garden and the Battle of the Bulge and beyond - ending in an fictional effort to stop the Nazis from creating an atomic bomb. During a mission, you find medical packs, ammunition (weapon specific), and new weapons as pickups lying around, or dropped by enemies killed - the drops disappear if not picked up in time. A mission takes place on a series of relatively small maps, separated into 'levels', and at the level transition points the player can save the game, and is also awarded skill points, new ranks and medals.The RPG aspect includes the initial character specialization, and between missions levels the player get skill points, which can be saved for later or allocated between missions to improve various combat skills:Hand-to-Hand, Pistol, SMG, Rifle, Heavy SMG, Stealth, Medic, Grenade and 'Combat Sense'.In single-player has classic run-and-gun gameplay. You use a player-centered bird's-eye view, and you must turn the character to spin the view as you can only shoot at enemies at the top of the screen, as opposed to the sniper mode, when you use a 1st person scoped view. The screen has a fixed scaling, there is no zoom or free pan, other than to automatically give you a few seconds look ahead when key locations are nearby. The player is kept in the center of the screen and the view window automatically slides over the battlefield as your character moves. Normally, enemies won't fire until they are within your view - but there are exceptions.In two-player coop mode, each player can shoot in the direction their character is facing, and do not need to rotate the view to hit the enemy. The players cannot be farther apart than the screen size, which is fixed. The screen is centered between the player characters in this mode. If players are far apart at opposite edges of the screen, they can often be shot at from off-screen enemies, as enemies are triggered by being close enough - about half the screen size away on the map, no matter if you can see them yourself.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Peter Jackson's King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-11-21</td><td>Ubisoft, Inc.</td><td>Ubisoft Pictures SAS</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td>Interwar</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Jack Driscoll, scriptwriter, follows director Carl Dernham and actress Ann Darrow to Skull Island where Dernham intends to film his next movie.

The story revolves around the new crusade of our hero to recover 3 ancient pagan artifacts essential to prevent the imminent attack of the demon armies into our realm of existence.It is a 3D 3rd-person action game with RPG elements. Gameplay consists of completing quests through travelling in the various locations in the game or battling your way through enemy men and monsters.The storyline for one is non-linear. At the start of the game you can choose 1 out of 3 locations to visit. Advancing in the game will unlock new locations. Each location is either a city or town where you can advance in the primary mission, obtain sub-quests, trade, meet people, etc. or it could be a dungeon type location crawling with monsters. Often its a little combination of both.Most of the gameplay (when not exploring cities) revolve around combat and character development. Combat consists of 3D 3rd Person Perspective point of view where you can attack enemies using various skills, abilities and attack combo's. Each of which can be upgraded at any point of the game by spending experience points to the pointed skill, ability or combo.On character development, there are 3 major areas that may be upgraded: (1) Knightly Abilities; Spiritually oriented gifts of the Templar knight: from healing to other holy abilities. (2) Skill Abilities; These are usually attack-based skills. Various attacking styles to soften and defeat both men and monster. (3) Combo's. The extension of the "attack button". Upgrading the combo section provides additional attack moves.Combat also is uniquely divided into 3 different weapons. The first is the standard Sword and Shield, providing high defense and standard attack, useful in defensive stances and vs. ranged enemies; The second is the 2-handed weapon, primary for direct damage in close-combat against single or multiple enemies; The third is ranged combat using a crossbow. The perspective in ranged combat diverts to 1st person perspective (though you can still see your head). During the course of the game, you can obtain additional weapons and armor (as well as other items), either from the course of a sub-quest or purchasing it from a local trader.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Ski Racing 2006: Featuring Hermann Maier</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-12-01</td><td>JoWooD Productions Software AG</td><td>Coldwood Interactive AB</td><td>Racing / Driving, Sports</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Ski Racing 2006 is an officially licensed downhill racing game on skis.

Their hopes for a peaceful and happy future together are dashed, however, when they arrive in Persia to find the land ravaged by war. Kaileena is promptly captured and murdered by the evil Vizier, and her death unleashes the Sands of Time, from which the Vizier derives terrifying new powers.Once again the Prince of Persia must stand to fight, but this time he will be stronger than ever, thanks to his new alter ego the Dark Prince, born of the Prince's contact with the Sands. As he fights to reclaim his kingdom from the hands of a madman, he must also battle with his own inner demons as the Dark Prince threatens to consume him entirely.The game is very similar (in terms of fight and puzzle sequences) to the previous installments of UbiSoft's Prince of Persia trilogy: The Sands of Time and Warrior Within. There are some major innovations like the character of the Dark Prince, who possesses the main protagonist from time to time and offers him new combos and moves. There is also a new ability, called "Speed Kill", which is very effective against all opponents in the game (victims are attacked from behind and murdered in brutal and stealthy fashion).In Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones player will explore not only the streets of Babylon, but also a ruined palace of his father, a temple and the famous Hanging Gardens.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Gauntlet: Seven Sorrows</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2005-12-12</td><td>Midway Home Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Midway Studios - San Diego</td><td>Action</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Puzzle elements</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td>Isometric</td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Gauntlet is back for yet another iteration. The Emperor has crucified his four loyal heroes to a magic tree, driven by a maniac thirst for their immortality. Hundreds of years later, as only a ghost, he came to regret all the wrong deeds he has done and frees them, asking them to defeat his six former advisors in an attempt to undo what he has done.This version of Gauntlet goes back to the roots: The warrior, valkyrie, elf, and wizard fight their way through hordes of enemies to make their way to the six bosses. The game is mostly a hack'n'slash affair, puzzles are limited to finding keys and pressing buttons that open doors and portals. Every character has a unique set of moves and attacks: The warrior has rather powerful attacks, the valkyrie has quick moves, the elf can shoot powerful arrows, and the wizard has several magical range attacks.Defeating enemies gives you experience points that may be used to increase your three stats; some chests in the levels contain better armor or weapons. Also, new moves can be purchased with gold.The game can be played both in single-player as well as cooperative multi-player, where up to four players fight together.The newest feature of this game (other than the much better graphics) is the online gaming feature.

As with the original 1992 game, Sensible Soccer 2006 is a fast-paced football game viewed from a bird's perspective (although the camera has been slightly tilted). The control has gone from one button to three buttons, as you use one for shooting, another for passing and the third for sprinting. In addition to that you use the stick on gamepads to aim and to apply the famous after-touch.The game contains a total of around 350 different teams (international and club teams) and 50 preset competitions. If that is not enough, players can create their own custom teams. This is the career mode of the game. The objective is to create a squad of rookie players and take them to the top of the team rankings.

In the game's time frame, this is the earliest game, hence the Japanese title Samurai Spirits Zero. It takes place in 1786 from January through the later summer. The game is therefore considered a prequel to the series.The overall gameplay was slightly altered. It is a little faster, and the Slash/Bust system has been removed. Each character now has only one version, or the Bust mode is simply replaced by a new character of very similar setup. Combo slashes, sidestepping and fatalities have also vanished. The basic moves have been modeled after the first games in the series. They consist of three types of slashes, a single kick, and various dodge maneuvers similar to Samurai Shodown II.There are 24 characters, a familiar cast with some new faces. Unlike the previous games, it is not possible to kill your opponent.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Torino 2006</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-01-24</td><td>2K Games, Inc.</td><td>49Games GmbH</td><td>Sports</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Torino 2006 is the official game of the XX Winter Olympic Games held in Turin, Italy, and the eight in the line of multi-event IOC licensed titles. The game includes 15 events scattered on 8 disciplines: Alpine Skiing (Downhill, Super G, Giant Slalom and Slalom), Ski Jump (Normal and Large hill), Speed Skating (500m, 1000m and 1500m), Women's Biathlon, Nordic Combined, Bobsled (Womens' 2 and Mens' 4), Luge and Cross Country. All venues were modelled after their real counterparts.Gameplay, as expected, requires more reflexes than the button-bashing of their Summer counterparts. Alpine Skiing is a matter of skill and quick reflexes, as the player, other than set the direction, only has to choose when to crouch to gain speed (mostly in Downhill and Giant Slalom) and when to carve the snow for sharper turns (either to correct a bad trajectory or approach a tighter gate). These events are based on a simplified version of the engine that power Ski Alpin 2006, also by 49Games. Unlike most other games that feature alpine skiing, the penalty for missing gate depends on the difficulty level chosen: on easy, six misses are allowed, three in medium and none on hard, each carrying a time penalty that depending on how well the player did can just affect the total score or mean losing a medal.Ski Jump (also a simplified version of another game, RTL Skispringen 2006) requires the player to keep the balance while descending the hill, jumping at the correct time, counter the effect of the wind in the athletes' balance for maximum distance and then land in perfect telemark fashion.Cross Country and Biathlon are relaxed disciplines where all that counts is keeping the best trajectory possible while looking out for straight paths that can be used for short sprints and downhill slopes that can be done while crouching, which allows greater speeds and lower fatigue accumulated from sprints and more hasty climbs. Biathlon is pretty much the same as Cross Country, except it also includes two shooting sessions, with the steadiness of the aim affected by the fatigue levels.Skating disciplines require a strong, well timed start, and then accurate button pressing as the skater makes each step. 
Bobsled and Luge are similar with only two differences: The startup in Bobsled is done by following the on-screen cues and press up on the right time and other than setting the direction, it's also possible to make minimal path changes. The winner is the fastest competitor after two heats (instead of the official four).Nordic Combined is a Large hill ski jump which sets the start time for each competitor in the Cross country section.It's possible to compete in all 15 or just 9 events, or even create your own competition, with up to four competitors. At each competition the players aim for both medals and the score table, based on the results on each individual event. However, the challenge does not stop with winning medals. The player can unlock additional strips by completing challenges, such as hitting all 10 targets in Biathlon, having a perfect Bobsled start, winning a gold medal and beat each top record on every event or not missing a single step on Speed Skating. The difficulty level affects events differently: in Alpine skiing,  it means CPU-controlled players are faster and fewer gate misses are allowed, in Ski jump wind can appear from any direction and in Speed skating, in addition to set the pace, the player also has to steer the athlete to keep her in the best path.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">World War II Combat: Road to Berlin</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-01-24</td><td>Groove Games</td><td>Direct Action Games</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td>World War II</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">A follow-up to Combat: Task Force 121, World War II Combat: Road to Berlin shares the same basic mechanics and multiplayer functionality as its predecessor.

It is still considered live at this point.  Obviously, this makes the game much faster-paced and higher-scoring.Features include a coach's pick which will recommend plays, a telemetry view, which lets you see how tired both your players and the opposing ones are along with passing routes so you can set good match-ups, a quick play mode, a season mode, which allows you to go up to 20 seasons and trade players, set salaries, etc, practice and online play.Arena Football is officially licensed by the Arena Football League and includes all the teams and players from the 2006 season.

In the oppressed city of New Radius, you need to establish your name as an artist by laying down tags, burners and full pieces, but rival crews and law enforcement (Civil Conduct Keepers) are always on your tail. You will also uncover a conspiracy that plagues the city.The game is story-driven with linear level progression. Most missions have platform elements and require you to lay art, varying from tags and stickers to complex pieces with full color, lettering and characters, on often difficult to reach surfaces. As it is not a friendly environment, Trane can deliver a host of punch and kick combos, use grabs, humiliate other artists, and interact with the surroundings. Your art arsenal includes markers, brushes, cans and rollers. All available pieces are kept in your black book, and new styles are unlocked while playing.The title refers to working your way up the scene, as well as the "Get In, Get Up, and Get Out" principle - you need to gain access to restricted areas, get up on tall objects where your work can be seen, and get out afterwards without being caught. Good spots can be tracked using Intuition, and appear as coloured clouds.The game is conceived by clothing impresario Marc Ecko, founder of the suburban designer label Ecko and is intended to pay tribute to graffiti culture and its history. Artists such as Cope2, Futura and Seen contributed art to the game.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Marc Ecko's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure (Limited Edition)</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-02-14</td><td>Atari, Inc.</td><td>Collective, Inc., The</td><td>Special edition</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The limited edition of Getting Up has the original game in a collectible tin case and includes:The soundtrackA silver pen with the Getting Up "X" logoMarc Ecko's Blackbook, offering a look inside the game's development processA disc featuring a collection of short films chronicling the myth and history of graffiti subculture, level rundowns, game tips, and "making of" footage

The World Tour mode has the player starting a racing career and, with the help of a Scottish manager, attempting to gain renown and acceptance into more famous racing events. There are 3D rendered cutscenes shown from the player's point-of-view, which move the story along and, while not as detailed as its predecessor, gives a good idea of the back scenes of a professional racer's life aside from just the racing. This mode includes mixtures from all the racing disciplines.The second mode allows the player to choose one discipline and play a career focused on that choice. This mode has no back-story and longer, more realistic races.TOCA Race Driver 3 provides two different driving models, Simulation and Pro-Simulation. The latter is recommended for gamers with analog steering wheels only. Simulation is intended for gamers without wheels, or who want an easier experience.

The game takes place in Mexico City, where separatists have attacked a North American summit, leading to the Canadian Prime Minister being killed and the Mexican and US presidents gone missing. Throughout the campaign, the player will need to rescue the presidents, recover a nuclear football and defeat the leader of the separatists. This version of the game has a more streamlined level design, is less tactical than the other versions of the game, and is entirely played from a first-person perspective. Although the story, mission objectives, weapons and characters are the same as the Xbox 360 version, it has different level design and uses the UnrealEngine2 rather than the Yeti Engine.

In 1978, TK (who was then an 18-year-old driver-for-hire who had just graduated from high school) was sentenced to 28 years in prison for a crime he did not commit, and is released from prison in 2006. Now, with his driving skills, he seeks revenge against the police department for having to serve time for something someone else should've gone to prison for!Unlike Driv3r, Driver: Parallel Lines mostly takes place behind the wheel, returning back to the formula that made the first game a classic. The game still has a GTA-style open-ended design, though, and you can still exit your vehicle for some on-foot action. However, there's no reason to exit your vehicle unless it's damaged and you can no longer drive it, as almost all of the game's missions involve cop car chases. If that's the case, then you can either go to the repair shop to repair your vehicle, or just steal someone else's vehicle! Until then, you can punch the cops with your fists and steal their weapons when they're dead, so that you can use them for future on-foot combat.The game takes place in both 1978 (before TK went to prison) and in 2006. The 2006 setting has a much more modern soundtrack than the 1978 setting, which has a mostly disco soundtrack. Obviously, the 2006 setting has the architecture, technology, and cars of today.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Ice Age 2: The Meltdown</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-03-14</td><td>Sierra Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Eurocom Developments Ltd</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Platform, Puzzle elements</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone 10+</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Ice Age 2: The Meltdown is loosely based on the movie of the same name.

Scrat has a few special moves as well, such as sniff, his spin attack, a double jump, a ground stomp (useful for breaking ice), and a roll attack. Much of the game consists of hunting down acorns and other special nuts for health renewal or for unlocking bonuses. There are a few mini-games within the game - you can play as Sid, zipping along an ice slide while avoiding obstacles; there's also penguin-bowling and a mini-game where you "shoot" at monkeys to regain a walnut that was whisked out from under your nose.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Critical Hour</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-03-14</td><td>Ubisoft, Inc.</td><td>Ubisoft Quebec City Studio</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Shooter, Tactical shooter</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Critical Hour is the fourth Rainbow Six game to appear on the consoles.

The gameplay is quite varied, with about 18 flyable planes during the SP campaign (fighters, recon planes, dive, torpedo and level bombers) and diverse tasks and locations that prevent the game from being overly repetitive, despite a general dogfighting approach. The basic squadron command system and the specific abilities of the wingmen lend a bit of a tactical flavor to the game.There are a dozen multiplayer game modes available: solo (Dogfight, Seek and Destroy & Aces High), co-op (Dogfight, Onslaught, Bombing Run, Kamikaze and Historical Missions) and squad-based (Dogfight, Capture the Base, Bombing Run and Kamikaze).</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Monster 4x4: World Circuit</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-03-23</td><td>Ubisoft, Inc.</td><td>Ubi Studios SL</td><td>Racing / Driving</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Automobile, Off-roading, Track racing</td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This game has over 20 monster trucks and 30 circuits that take you all over the world.

It also has new features such as a momentum meter, the more players either in favor or against a team, the more the meter will light up or darken, affecting the teams morale and success of plays. It also has a new kicking meter along with spring drills, letting players update their stats along with a new Spring Game where players can scout out their new players in exhibition games.Aside from the PSP version, Campus Legend is also a novelty - an update of the Race for the Heisman mode of the previous edition and it is quite similar to the NFL Superstar mode from the Madden franchise. A new player starts at football camp, practises and is eventually awarded a scholarship to play in a division. Rather than a single drill, it is now a series of four. Where in the previous version players could choose a scholarship, the game now offers a selection from the available schools based on the performances. Once enrolled, players choose a major, follow progress reports, read headlines in the school newspaper and have a dorm room where fan mail arrives. The player's girlfriend, shown as a photo of the wall, becomes more beautiful based on the success in the games. Days consist of attending classes, practice, studying, meeting tutors, drills or social activities. These can also boost popularity and overall success.

As such, the gameplay is very similar to that game. For instance, you can heal yourself with a portable healing tool, and run at speeds so fast that they blur your vision. The main difference between the two games is that the singleplayer game is multiplayer-oriented, similar to Unreal Tournament. There is a storyline, however. You can select from one of three races fighting for the control of a beautiful, resource-rich planet named Kaladi. The Ohm are a cyborg-like race that need the planet's resources to live. The House of Kovos are robots that want to take control of Kaladi because their religion says that they should. The Human Coalition is a group of homeless humans that are trying to find a home.In the singleplayer game, each arena is connected by a turn-based, Risk-style minigame. There's a zone for each side of the war, each with five arenas, for a total of 15 arenas. When it's your turn, you can choose an arena to attack that's owned by either of the other two sides. When you attack, the other side will try to defend the arena. If you win, you take control of that arena. If you win an attack on certain arenas, you can unlock a new weapon in the game. If you have control of all 15 arenas, you get to play a surprise "boss" arena.Warpath's weapons and healing tool are also upgradeable. In singleplayer, you get skill-based weapon upgrades between levels. In multiplayer, you upgrade weapons just like you did in Pariah -- pick up weapon energy cores from fallen enemies and upgrade your weapons during gameplay.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">World War II Combat: Iwo Jima</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-07-18</td><td>Groove Games</td><td>Direct Action Games</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td></td><td>Shooter</td><td>World War II</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">World War II Combat: Iwo Jima is a follow-up to World War II Combat: Road to Berlin, sporting the same gameplay mechanics and budget price tag of its predecessor.The gameplay is basically just like any other first-person shooter out there, but you can't pick up any weapons or health during a mission -- instead, your health recharges at the end of each mission and your weapons are automatically assigned for each mission.The main difference between Road to Berlin and Iwo Jima is that you're now pitted against the Japanese instead of the Germans, as the only surviving member of a squad of Marines during the American conquest of the Japanese island Iwo Jima.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Painkiller: Hell Wars</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-07-25</td><td>DreamCatcher Interactive Inc.</td><td>People Can Fly, Sp. z o.o.</td><td>Action, Compilation</td><td>1st-person</td><td></td><td>Horror</td><td>Shooter</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">This Xbox version of Painkiller is a collection of the best levels from the original game and its expansion pack, Battle Out of Hell.

You'll blast your way through hordes of monsters as you fight for your purification.Like the original game, Painkiller: Hell Wars is a retro shooter that plays very similarly to Quake. Your weapons don't need to be reloaded, and switching from weapon to weapon is very quick (no weapon switching animations), a nod to the original Quake. You can collect souls from your fallen enemies to gain health, and collecting 66 souls will turn you into an invincible demon that can instantly kill his enemies with a screen-blurring projectile. If you do well, you'll even be rewarded with power-ups in the form of tarot cards.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">FlatOut 2</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-08-01</td><td>Empire Interactive Entertainment</td><td>Bugbear Entertainment Oy</td><td>Action, Racing / Driving</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td>Regional differences</td><td></td><td>Tricks / stunts</td><td></td><td>Automobile, Off-roading, Track racing</td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">As in FlatOut your goal is to drive as reckless as you can and still win the race. But contrary to its predecessor, FlatOut 2 is now a complete arcade-racing game.The core of the game is the career mode which features 3 different racing-classes: Derby, Race and Street. Every class is also divided into 3 levels. You begin your career in the derby class level 1. Here you drive old, wrecked cars straight from the dump. As you progress to the race class and finally to the street class you can buy better and faster cars which you can then also tune to your needs, like installing a new engine.Inside the classes you find different kinds of events: from normal races over Destruction Derbies to stunt events. All of the events feature a fully destructible environment. This is not only eye-candy but is also required to fill up your nitro and handicap your enemies.If you get bored of that, you can play one of the 12 mini-games. Like in FlatOut your goal here is to do all kinds of crazy stuff with your driver. You can use him as a football, throw him through burning rings and more. These mini-games can also be played with up to 8 players on one PC in a hot-seat mode.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Xyanide</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-08-15</td><td>Evolved Games</td><td>Playlogic Game Factory BV</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other), Side view, Top-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Arcade, Shooter</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The space-witch Aguira, a young fragile girl, has turned the world of Mardar into living hell. Her sentence is death by the Maelstrom, a gigantic black hole.  But on route to the Maelstrom, the ship that carries her is hit by a meteorite full of Xyanide, which allows her to materialize her thoughts and escape.  Her first target, unsurprisingly, is Drake, her executioner who accompanies her into the Maelstrom. His ship becomes entangled into her world, and he has to fight her demons and destroy the crystals that power her devilish creations.  Xyanide is essentially a 2D shooter, though technically, the graphics are three-dimensional. The player character advances automatically, the screen scrolling forward and often changing the camera view. The path is not entirely linear: at certain intersections, the player can choose where to go next. The game encompasses six large levels; regular enemies, mid-bosses, and end bosses will try to do everything in their might to foil Drake's mission.Drake's ship has two primary weapons, which can be switched at any time. One is a spread attack normally used against small enemies; the other is a concentrated laser that's effective against bigger targets. Both weapons also have an alternate firing mode, homing missiles. All these can be upgraded during the course of the game. Collecting power-ups not only strengthens the weapons, but allows the ship to perform various offensive and defensive manoeuvres.The game is story-driven; animated cutscenes appear between the levels, advancing the plot. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Madden NFL 07</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-08-22</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>EA Tiburon</td><td>Sports</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Madden NFL 07 is the seventeenth installment of the Madden NFL series.

The gameplay and available modes are fairly identical to the previous game (including the team racing controls), but the pace has been kicked up a notch, with an added blur effect to enhance the sense of speed. A new feature is the Adrenaline meter. When full, it offers improved handling and speed. Drivers now carry ranks with different attributes (Dynamic Driver Attributes) and racing tendencies. Specific drivers will perform better on certain tracks. Players can earn skill points to improve their attributes by keeping a lead, making clean passes, intimidation or survive dangerous situations.The main modes are Race Now, Season Mode, Chase for the Cup, Fight to the Top (Whelen Modified series, Craftsman Series, Craftsman Trucks, NBS, and NEXTEL Cup), Online Races (Quick Matches and Optimatch - where the host can fully define the event) and Dodge Challenges. The Dodge Speed Zone mode is no longer included. Important racers are shown in FMV interviews prior to Dodge Challenge races. As usual, the car can be tweaked and fine-tuned in many ways.This is the first NASCAR game to appear on the PSP. It is fairly similar to the console versions, but does not include Total Team Control to talk with the team. The handheld version includes a new feature: Instant Rewind. While racing, a meter builds up with time, which can be used to rewind the game action when crashing or taking a bad turn. A few of the game modes are different.Sterrance is featured on the US cover, as the driver for the #12 Alltel Dodge.

Players use LEGO-ized Star Wars characters to reenact all three of the original movies. All of the sets and props are also made out of LEGO bricks, and retain their properties such as the ability to be rebuilt and fall apart.  Like its predecessor, the game puts a spin on the series by adding a light-hearted, humorous touch to the movies, and also by using no dialogue.  LEGO Star Wars II is a third-person action game with platforming elements. Players take control of the characters and vehicles of Star Wars. In Story Mode, players reenact the key events of the original movies with LEGO bricks. Each character has different weapons, like lightsabers for Jedi or crossbows for Wookies, as well as new character-specific attacks and maneuvers. Each character also has different abilities, e.g. Jedi being able to use the force, R2-D2 being able to unlock doors, or Boba Fett being able to use his jetpack. It is up to the player to use these abilities to solve simple puzzles and traverse the levels of the game. Vehicle levels are more prominently featured than in the previous game, with longer sequences dedicated to piloting traditional Star Wars aircraft.In addition to a single-player game, there is also a co-op mode that allows two players to go through the Story Mode. In the single-player mode, the second character is controlled by the AI. Like in the first game, the Free-play mode allows players to go back and replay beaten levels with any playable character they have unlocked. A new feature allows players to create their own mixed-up LEGO characters and vehicles. Power Brock items and coin stubs collected in Story Mode will also unlock new characters, vehicles, and items for players to experiment with.  </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">NHL 07</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-09-12</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Electronic Arts Montreal</td><td>Sports</td><td>Behind view, Diagonal-down, Side view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Managerial / business simulation</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Everyone 10+</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">EA Sports' 2007 installment of their NHL Hockey franchise refreshes all of the existing NHL team rosters and schedules and adds the Czech Elite League teams to the European Elite League rosters.Player modeling has been improved and features new life-like player specific moves and styles.

This parametric camera is closer down than a typical top-down camera and includes automatic zooming and turning based on the players' position on the ice. Other improvements are the option to shadow opponents to put pressure on them and increase their chance of making a mistake. This is done by holding the left bumper and steering the right control stick towards another player. The amount of pressure can then be determined through taps, with hard tapping inevitably leading to a powerful check.Aside from that, the game modes from the previous version are identical, as is most of the gameplay and the mini-games included. It has a new rivalry system where statistical bonuses and takeaways are created depending on how players play in games against their rival teams. The main improvements introduced to the Xbox 360 version of the game, such as the "cinematic" presentation system, are not carried over. This is most visible in the graphical area.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Open Season</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-09-12</td><td>Ubisoft, Inc.</td><td>Ubisoft Entertainment Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>Behind view</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Puzzle elements</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone 10+</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In this game the player takes the role of Boog, a domesticated bear who tries to return to the civilization after being released in a nearby forest due to an unfortunate misadventure, and Elliot, a crazy, one-horned deer who desires to be Boog's partner.In order to achieve his goal, Boog will have to prove himself to the creatures of the forest by helping them to get rid of the hunters.

Unlike its predecessors, this version has an urban atmosphere. The road races, off-road challenges and circuit tracks have been removed and the action has been taken entirely to the streets of Los Angeles, with 24 tracks available. As in the previous version, the 18 available cars are all Fords, ranging from the 1968 Mustang GT to the 2007 Shelby GT 500.There are 4 main modes: Quick Race, Team Racing, Solo Racing and Multiplayer. Solo Racing offers quick races, and championships where new vehicles and tracks can be unlocked. The real novelty is the Team Racing mode, split up in single races, team championships, challenges and tutorials. Team Racing has the player control two or three vehicles in a single team during a race in modes such as Race, Elimination or Duel. The team with the highest point total wins, so the player either has to switch between the vehicles to drive (the others cars then become AI-controlled) or issue orders such as Block (slow down another vehicle) or Draft (additional speed in the slipstream) to influence the driving behaviour of the team mates. This can be extended to double or even triple actions of the same effect. Blocked cars have to brake and weave across the track until they regain control.Racing or completing challenges earns credits, which can be spent to buy new vehicles in the showroom. Despite the urban theme, there are no tuning options. Cars can only be viewed, repaired and sold. The PSP version adds 6 new Ford cars (1962 Thunderbird Sports Roadster, 1971 Mustang Mach 1, 2004 Bronco Concept, 2005 Shelby GR-1 Concept, 2005 SVT Sport Trac Adrenalin Concept, 2005 Thunderbird) and 7 new tracks. In the Team Racing mode, two cars can be controlled (3 in the console versions) and solo and team multiplayer is supported over Wi-Fi.There is also an alternate Australian PS2 release Ford Street Racing (XR Edition), with 4 additional cars synonymous with the history of Ford in Australia: the 1970 Ford XY GT Falcon, the 1970 Ford XY GTHO Falcon (Phase III), the 2003 Falcon XR8 Ute and the Australian Falcon XR8. That version is also the only PSP version released in Australia.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">NBA 2K7</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-09-25</td><td>2K Games, Inc.</td><td>Visual Concepts Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Sports</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td>Released</td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">NBA 2K7 continues the tradition of the NBA 2K series into the next generation for the first time.

This is accomplished by a three-stages fight in which you have to go up against a huge army of government forces.As a fully trained agent, Rico can also perform many stunts. He has always an parachute equipped which he can open whenever he has enough speed. So he often uses cars or bikes as a jump-pad and then sails smoothly into the sunset.But of course he cannot impress the evil regime with that, so he also has access to a wide range of weapons from pistols with unlimited ammo to rocket launchers and machine guns.

Over 510 teams are accurately represented in the game. 27 leagues from 20 nations are included, along a "Rest of the World" for the best teams in championships left outside the game and international teams. Spain, England (with two), France, Germany, and Italy also feature second divisions. Players can also create two clubs, customizing their badge, kits and home stadium, selecting players from anywhere in the game, along with the starting budget in manager mode. The player creation tool remains mostly unchanged, with the ability to customize everything, from faces  (with a complete set of options, from jaw width to eyebrow shape) to the appearance and playing abilities.While the focus of this yearly update was on the game engine, the Manager mode was also enhanced: players now also improve their playing ability from being active members of the squad, forcing the player to choose between keeping his celebrated stars near retirement in the starting eleven or give the benefits of the youth system a chance to shine. Another new feature, in what is now the primary mode of the series, is the ability to watch the game in a simplified text mode, with the ability to jump into action to turn the events still available. The points system was replaced by a less abstract currency model (with the ability to choose between Pounds, Euros or Dollars). Other game modes include Tournaments (including the creation of custom tournaments) and Challenges. By completing challenges (similar to the Global Challenges mode in World Cup 2006) the player can spend points in the Fanshop with items such as new teams, a special overhead camera, new balls from Adidas (including all original World Cup balls from 1974 to 2002), stadiums, third kits and special celebrations for created players.Finally, online gaming received a new mode: Interactive Leagues. These are online-only leagues based on the fixtures of their real counterparts (English Premier League, French Ligue 1, German Bundesliga, and Mexican 1st division). Then, online players go head-to-head with their favorite teams with a victory counting one vote for their favorite team. Once the week is over, the team with more votes is declared the winner of the week, getting three points. The number of weekly matches a player can do in this mode is unlimited.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Scarface: The World Is Yours</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-10-01</td><td>Sierra Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Radical Entertainment Inc.</td><td>Action, Racing / Driving</td><td>1st-person, Behind view</td><td>Licensed, Regional differences</td><td></td><td>Sandbox / open world, Shooter</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Miami in the '80s: gangs, drugs and hookers dominate the scene and a Cuban called Tony Montana rises up to be the most powerful drug dealer, controlling the whole of Miami. This is the story of the 1983 movie Scarface in which Tony Montana dies during a attack from a rival gang on his mansion at the end. The game now puts the player in the shoes of Tony a few moments before the gang hits his office.After he successfully defends his mansion, his empire lies in ruins. But Tony wouldn't be Tony Montana if he would just give up, so it is the player's goal to reclaim Miami once again. To do so, he has to earn money and respect. The only way to earn money in Miami is to deal drugs.  At the beginning the stuff is bought in small amounts and personally sold to the dealers. Eventually, however, Tony can set up so-called "Fronts" which are legitimate shops (like a car seller) in which drugs are sold in very large amounts. By overtaking "Fronts", Tony also increases his control over the current district of Miami. To completely overtake one part of town, all the enemy gangs scattered around in small groups must be eliminated.After a deal, Tony has to launder the money at the local bank and have it transferred to his account. He then can buy "exotics" for his mansion like an expensive vase or a new car with a driver.When talking with a dealer or trying to get cop heat down, the player has to play a mini-game that determines if Tony is successful and if so, how much he gets for the drugs or how much heat he loses.Respect is earned by increasing Tony's territory, buying exotics and earning "balls" in fights and while driving. The enemies have different target zones which give a different amount of balls on a hit. This also fills up Tony's 'ball-meter". Once this is full he can enter a kind of god mode in which he is invulnerable and has unlimited ammo. Tony also gets health when killing someone in this mode. If he is driving a car he gets balls when making stunts like driving on the wrong side of the road or dodging an incoming car.As in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, the player is free to roam the city of Miami and there are also some side-missions with racing events.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">NBA Live 07</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-10-06</td><td>Electronic Arts, Inc.</td><td>Electronic Arts Canada</td><td>Sports</td><td>Behind view, Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Managerial / business simulation</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Back of Case - Xbox (US) (from Ad Blurbs)ELEVATE YOUR GAME

Within each nation are people who can control that one element, known as benders. The Avatar is a person who can control all four elements and is charged with keeping the peace between the four nations. However, 100 years previous the Avatar had disappeared, making it possible for the Fire Nation to wage a war of conquest across the world. As the show begins, the new Avatar, Aang (originally an Airbender, hence the title of the series), has been found, and now he must travel the world, learning how to bend all four elements and fighting against the Fire Nation alongside his friends Katara (a Waterbender of the Water Tribe) and Sokka (her older brother).In the game, the player may choose one of four characters: Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Haru (an Earthbender). Each character's fighting style and abilities are unique, and new abilities can be gained as they earn experience by defeating enemies. Items are also available to assist the player, such as armor, chi, accessories, and healing potions. As an action/adventure game, the gameplay is viewed from a top-down perspective, with the player battling enemies and searching for specific items required the complete the quests necessary to progress further into the game. The story unfolds over several chapters, and players cannot return to previous areas.Set between the first and second seasons of the show, the game follows Aang and friends as they investigate the disappearance of a young Waterbender, and find themselves in pursuit of an inventor named Lian the Maker, who has been forced to create dangerous machines for the Fire Nation. As they travel between the Water Tribe and the Earth Kingdom, the characters battle Fire Nation soldiers, strange animals, and various machines. Some other characters from the world of Avatar also make minor appearances in the game, including Prince Zuko, who appears during cut scenes only.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-10-10</td><td>Vivendi Universal Games, Inc.</td><td>Krome Studios Pty Ltd.</td><td>Action</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td></td><td></td><td>Platform, Puzzle elements</td><td>Fantasy</td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Everyone 10+</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning deals with Spyro's birth and his journey to meet his destiny. The intro shows Spyro being rescued by a Guardian Dragon called Ignitus from the attack of the "Dark Master". After his eclosion, Spyro is raised by dragonflies in a swamp until one day he discovers that he is in fact a dragon, and he and his half-brother, the dragonfly Sparx, leave the swamp to find out more about Spyro's past and fight the forces of evil.In contrast to previous Spyro games, the emphasis is put on combat instead of platforming. Spyro can do several combat moves, using both his tail and his claws, and has four different breath attacks: fire, electricity, ice, and earth. The game also features several rail shooter passages similar to games like Panzer Dragoon.

As tradeoff, there are a few less traditional game modes (6 instead of 10) and less courses (18 instead of 21) available.

Earth is under attack again in another alien invasion. The setting is now the 1960s. You go around hunting Humans with your Zap-o-Matic, Ray Gun, or brand new weapons. Occasionally, there are probing missions where you can hypnotize a Human to do something to carry out your plans for the Furon Empire. There are also missions where you trick humans into being abducted by your ship. Crypto also has new weapons: the Dislocator, a gun that shoots purple discs and grabs anything (including tanks) to beat them up; the Meteor Strike, a gun that can rain down meteor showers upon the enemy... and another gun called Gastro, which is a hologram on a hovership that helps out Crypto. The side quests have fleshed-out stories now; in addition, there are cult missions where you convince humans to worship an Alien God. A Co-op mode has also been added. The entire game can be played through on a split-screen and the second player can join in or out of the action at any time through the pause menu. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Family Guy Video Game!</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-10-17</td><td>2K Games, Inc.</td><td>High Voltage Software, Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Platform, Puzzle elements, Shooter, Stealth</td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The Griffin family from Fox's animated TV series makes its way to video gaming for the first time.In this action-adventure, which runs like an episode from the show, players control Peter, Brian and Stewie through various goals and adventures.After being hit on the head by a satellite dish, Peter wakes up in a hospital believing that Mr. Belvedere (from the 1980's sitcom) has kidnapped his family, and everyone in town is an accomplice.  Peter makes his way through town beating up anyone who gets in his path, in a side-scrolling beat-em-up fighting mode.Brian is falsely accused of impregnating Carter Pewterschmidt's prized racing dog Seabreeze.  Brian must escape the police station without being seen and collect evidence proving that he is not the father.  Brian's game mode relies heavily on stealth/espionage gameplay.Stewie's battle against his half-brother Bertram continues as Stewie must destroy everything in his path to infiltrate a hospital and the inside of Peter in order to find Bertram's lair and stop him from taking over the world.  Stewie's adventure takes place as a platformer action game with shooting elements.Much like the show, there are segues which translate into mini-games that will yield power-ups for each mission if completed successfully.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Justice League Heroes</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-10-17</td><td>Warner Bros.

Control DC’s most popular heroes: Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter, The Flash, Zatanna and a handful of unlockable characters like Aquaman, Green Arrow, Hawkgirl, Huntress, Hal Jordan, and Kyle Rayner. In addition, the PSP version features exclusive unlockable heroes: Supergirl and Black Canary.Players battle through famous locations such as Metropolis, S.T.A.R. labs, and for the first time, the Justice League's Watchtower.Many of DC’s greatest villains face against our heroes including Braniac, Killer Frost, Darkseid, and Doomsday.  Boss battles are furious and unique, with no two defeated the same way.Superpowers are developed through experience orbs collected from a wide range of enemies such as The White Martians, Brainiac’s assassin droids, and alternate-dimensional creatures.  Some special orbs known as “boosts” can enhance superpowers.  The boosts range from enhanced damage, efficiency, attack range, luck, speed, and super power duration.  Multiple boosts can combine into a single, more powerful boost.  Players can allocate their orbs and boosts to customize heroes to best suit their playing style.Special shield icons placed throughout the game can be collected and spent to unlock characters and alternate costumes which affect the heroes' abilities as well their appearances. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Mortal Kombat: Armageddon</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-10-17</td><td>Midway Home Entertainment, Inc.</td><td>Midway Games, Inc.</td><td>Action, Racing / Driving</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td>Martial arts</td><td>Fighting</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Mortal Kombat: Armageddon brags a roster of 62 characters and sees the return of classic ones from the original Mortal Kombat, such as Reptile, Shang Tsung and Goro. The enhanced Konquest mode (story/adventure mode) improves over the preceding versions, but has a shorter length. There are now 64 arenas (including revamped versions of classic environments) which each have their own tweaks, such as the ridiculous amount of stage fatalities (fatalities are a fancy way of killing your opponent, including classic techniques such as the "spine-rip" or "arm-break"). In the new Kreate-a-character mode, you can design your own character and clothe them with familiar or new costumes. As described earlier, fatalities are a fancy way of killing your opponent and are pretty fun to watch. Various button presses and combos at the end of a fight will sometimes trigger fatality mode and if the right buttons are pressed the fatality can become a chain of fatalities. The Kreate-a-fatality allows you to redesign these finishers.Perhaps the most amusing addition for longtime fans is the debut of "Motor Kombat," a racing mini-game patterned after Nintendo's Mario Kart. Motor Kombat has players selecting a vehicle from the following ten characters: Sub-Zero, Bo' Rai Cho, Scorpion, Mileena, Kitana, Johnny Cage, Jax, Cyrax, Baraka, and Raiden. Each super-deformed driver performs his or her trademark move on rivals, from Raiden's electricity to Scorpion's spear attack. The themed courses also feature hazards of their own, including lava pools, spikes, fire, and more. Motor Kombat supports four players in a split-screen view, or up to eight online. </td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Marvel Ultimate Alliance</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-10-24</td><td>Activision Publishing, Inc.</td><td>Raven Software Corporation</td><td>Role-playing (RPG)</td><td>Diagonal-down</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Action RPG, Quick Time Events (QTEs)</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td>2D scrolling</td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Dr. Doom has united supervillains as the Masters of Evil.

Mix and match your choice of Marvel superheroes, in teams of four as you travel across the Marvel Universe to stop this threat. Certain teams such as The Fantastic Four and The New Avengers provide additional bonuses.Some heroes must be unlocked first. The game also features RPG elements, such as leveling up. When a hero gains a level, they earn points you can use to upgrade their skills. You also collect Shield Coins, which can be spent on boosts for your hero team. You explore various legendary Marvel locales, from Asgard, to Prince Namor's Atlantis, where you take on foes with punches, kicks and super powers. Super powers drain energy, however, so use them wisely. Combos can be achieved by combining super powers. Energy is restored by collecting blue orbs from fallen foes. Boss battles are like the comics themselves: titanic battles that often not only test brawn but your brain as well. With over 20 playable heroes plus all the cameos, there are over 100 heroes and villains.The game modes feature either single player, co-op, or online play. In general, Marvel Ultimate Alliance's gameplay can be considered an improved version of 2004's X-Men: Legends. The different versions are fairly identical.

Throughout the story you get to play all seven main characters, from Mr. Blonde to Mr. White. The missions are introduced by game engine cutscenes, which often recreate moments from the film. For example, in the first mission you see Mr. Pink holding his famous monologue "I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up!" and then you play Mr. Blue as the police arrives at the jewelry where your goal is to get out alive.To do so, you have two choices: be a psychopath and shoot your way out, or try the subtle approach without harming anyone. For instance, if you do not want to harm anyone you can take a hostage and then threaten the police to lay their weapons down and order them to face the wall. There are a few missions in which you must drive a car but mostly you walk through them. Like in the Hitman series, the game shows at the end of every mission how well you have done.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Melbourne Cup Challenge</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-10-26</td><td>Tru Blu Entertainment Pty Ltd</td><td>Sidhe Interactive</td><td>Racing / Driving, Simulation, Sports</td><td>Behind view, Side view</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Asia, Europe, Middle East, Oceania</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Cinematic camera</td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Melbourne Cup Challenge (also known as Frankie Dettori Racing) is a horse racing simulation game based on the Melbourne Cup, Australia's most prestigious annual Thoroughbred horse race.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-10-26</td><td>Ubisoft, Inc.</td><td>Ubisoft Entertainment Inc.</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person, 3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td>Spy / espionage</td><td>Shooter, Stealth</td><td>Africa, North America</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Mature</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Once, Sam Fisher was an agent of Third Echelon, assigned to infiltrate strongholds belonging to enemies of National Security, gather information and neutralize enemies if needed.Times are changing, America's enemies are looking at new options, finding ways to make themselves more deadly.

The career mode offers complete freedom in a city with a story mode supported by FMV cutscenes, as featured in Need for Speed: Most Wanted, but now also set in the Carbon Canyon, where racers duel for territory in the city below. There still are many police pursuits. At the same time, the focus on tuning and sculpting your car remains, as introduced in Need for Speed Underground. As you win money from races, you can visit garages and car lots to make improvements to your vehicle.Enhancements are still unlocked gradually, but the cars have now been divided over different tiers. There are about 40 cars to unlock. Many of them have been featured in previous installments, but there is a new selection and this year's edition introduces powerful muscle cars such as the Ford Mustang and Dodge Charger. Other features include the possibility to form your own crew, more detailed sculpting features, drifting races (introduced in NFS:U and replaced by drag races in NFS:MW) and the new car classes. The PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 versions offer online multiplayer, missing from the PS2, GC and Xbox releases. Up to eight players can race together, in the Pursuit Tag or Pursuit Knockout modes, with a few variations. Pursuit Tag is a race of one civilian car against cop cars. To become the civilian car, you have to tag it and then try to fend off the cops as long as possible until you are tagged again by other players. In Pursuit Knockout everyone starts as a civilian car, but the last one at the end of the first lap becomes a cop and needs to cause as much damage as possible to the other speeders. Another mode allows you to drive cooperatively (up to four players) in a single race.The city and the surroundings in the career mode have been divided into different territories, controlled by gangs. You are either invited or challenged to race in the sections and claim them as your own. To do so, you have to impress the gang leader by winning races until he challenges you for a duel - first in the city, then over the narrow roads of Carbon Canyon. Scores are based on proximity. You need to follow the boss in the first race, and he is in pursuit in the second one. There are 4 boss duels in total.The crew feature, with room for up to 6 cars, allows you to assign three roles to racers: drafters, scouts and blockers. These are supporting characters you can hire to help you win races. Drafters leave behind a coloured trail that makes it easier to find the way, scouts discover hidden shortcuts, and blockers try to cause mayhem to slow your opponents down. If you hire a scout, you get access to the new AutoSculpt feature. It enables you to modify the height of every part of your car through sliders, solely for visual effect. You can also buy full body kits.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Call of Duty 3</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-11-07</td><td>Activision Publishing, Inc.</td><td>Treyarch Corporation</td><td>Action</td><td>1st-person</td><td>Regional differences</td><td>War</td><td>Shooter</td><td>Historical events, World War II</td><td>Tank</td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">The third main Call of Duty game centers around Operation Cobra in Normandy, France, the World War II operation planned by United States Army General Omar Bradley to break out from the Normandy area after the previous month's D-Day landings. You play as 4 allied sides with American, Canadian, British and Polish soldiers in 14 chronological singleplayer missions covering the 88 days leading up to the liberation of Paris. Surprisingly, you cannot play as the French 2nd Armored Division that actually liberated Paris.The battles are usually dramatic with many fights and scripted events at the same time, consisting of infantry and vehicles, with semi-destructible environments. In between, there are cinematics that explain the events. A few gameplay mechanics have been kept intact or make a return: slight auto aim, the damage system that allows you to recover if you hide for a moment, and smoke grenades. New features include the ability to toss back unexploded grenades and actions requiring a successful series of button combinations. This can occur in hand-to-hand combat where you can yank the weapon out of enemy soldiers' hands. Enemies work in groups, try different tactics and search for cover.The main multiplayer modes are standard deathmatch (battle), team deathmatch (team battle), Capture the Flag (either with two flags or two sides trying to control a single, neutral flag) and Headquarters (two sides either defend or attack a structure, and players can now respawn after dying). The new mode, War, is similar to the gameplay of the Battlefield series. Two teams start with two control points each, and one neutral flag in the middle. The objective is to control all five flags.There are multiple-occupancy vehicles (Sherman Tank, Panzer IV, Jeep, Horch, BMW, Harley), and several multiplayer classes: Rifleman, Heavy Assault, Light Assault, Medic, Scout, Support and Anti-Armor. Each class has unique abilities. There are also two rankings: a normal rank system during a single game where your abilities improve if you do well, and an overall TrueSkill ranking. Also, unlike the previous games, your team stays grouped together after a match and is not booted back to the lobby right away.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Tony Hawk's Project 8</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-11-07</td><td>Activision Publishing, Inc.</td><td>Neversoft Entertainment, Inc., Shaba Games LLC</td><td>Sports</td><td>Behind view</td><td>Licensed, Regional differences</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Direct control</td><td></td><td>Teen</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">In Tony Hawk's Project 8, The Birdman is out looking for the top 8 skaters for his new Project and it happens that he has stopped in your city to search for the best top skaters.

In contrast to other golf simulations the tee is performed in first person mode. After choosing the club and the feet position the player needs to use both analog sticks. With the left one he simulates the swing and with the right one he relocates his body weight. It is not enough to relocate it simply in the right direction, the player needs to achieve a constant back and forth movement. This only works when using a gamepad, alternatively there is also a more traditional three-click control scheme in 3rd person. There the player chooses the body weight movement before the strike. With the first click he strikes out, with the second one he determines the precision and with the last one the strength. This, however, is still different to other golf simulations because the kind of swing is not chosen beforehand but determined by the swing parameters.Less innovative are the playing modes. The game features the usual training, single tournament and career mode. The career mode however are just many tournaments tacked together. The player character improves his rank with successes but this just influences the conditions of participation for other tournaments and not the gameplay itself.The game features nine licensed golfers, 18 courses (two licensed) and three real-life golf-commentators. With the editor the player can build own courses and tournaments.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">Teen Titans</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-11-13</td><td>THQ Inc.</td><td>Artificial Mind & Movement</td><td>Action</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td>Beat 'em up / brawler</td><td>Sci-fi / futuristic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone 10+</td><td></td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">Teen Titans is based on the cartoon of the same name.

The objective is to sneak up on famished people and present them with tasty Burger King Hamburgers before they pass out from hunger.  Throughout 20 missions and four different environments: saw mill, cul de sac, construction zone, and a downtown area, The King can use the environments to keep the element of surprise by hiding in garbage cans and other similar areas.  If the person sees you while you are trying to deliver food, they'll lose their appetite.Each time you successfully deliver food, you're treated to a little dance from The King and a cheer of appreciation from the recipient.How many points the player receives depends on how The King delivers the food: How close you get to the person before handing off the food, people who are closer to fainting, making consecutive deliveries without being seen will start a chain multiplier, and filling a bar for a flourish bonus. The fuller the bar is, the more of a reward you'll get. The higher the flourish, the more involved The King's dance is. The last factor in scoring is whether you sneak up behind the person, or surprise them from a stationary position.</td></tr><tr><td style="min-width: 200px;">College Hoops NCAA 2K7</td><td style="min-width: 80px;">2006-11-20</td><td>2K Games, Inc.</td><td>Visual Concepts, Ltd.</td><td>Sports</td><td>3rd-person (Other)</td><td>Licensed</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>Everyone</td><td>Released</td><td>Xbox</td><td style="font-size:2px;">College Hoops 2K7 is the update of College Hoops 2K6 and a continuation of 2K's NCAA basketball franchise.

The player controls a single piece with one colour and can freely move it around the board as long as there is room.To create a match the player moves the active piece directly into a block where one of the two pieces has that colour. Both pieces disappear and the player takes control of the remaining piece, with a different colour. This mechanic is used to clear a field quickly and to prevent it from reaching the bottom which will lead to the end of the game. There is a timer on the right that shows when the rows are moving down next, but the player can move as fast as possible regardless of that.The second game mode is the Tactic mode. It is a slower puzzle mode where only a limited amount of moves are available to prevent the rows from constantly reaching the bottom. The final mode is the competitive multiplayer mode with local multiplayer for two players simultaneously, each controlling a piece on the same screen.All platforms listed here.
